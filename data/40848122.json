  "title": "Synthetic Peptides Suppress Nervous Necrosis Virus Absorption and Improve Survival Rates in European Sea Bass.",
  "abstract": "With few preventive strategies available against nodavirus (NNV) in aquaculture, therapeutic applications remain underexplored. This study aimed to peptide-based treatments disrupting critical stages of its viral life cycle. Thus, we designed and synthesized seven low-molecular-weight peptides (P1-P7) based on predicted binding regions of the capsid protein from the red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) genotype to mimic viral capsid regions. Although in silico predictions suggested limited direct antiviral activity, in vitro assays using the E-11 cell line and in vivo trials in RGNNV-infected European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) juveniles yielded promising results. The peptides, particularly when co-administered individually or as P3 + P4 and P5 + P6 combinations with the virus, disrupted RGNNV attachment in vitro. Moreover, they exhibited cross-reactivity against the striped jack nervous necrosis virus (SJNNV) genotype and both RGNNV/SJNNV and SJNNV/RGNNV reassortants. Treatment of RGNNV-infected sea bass significantly increased the relative percent survival, ranging from 81.3% for P4 to 62.5% for P3 and P3 + P4, while reducing viral load within 48 h post-treatment without altering systemic antiviral immune responses, tested through the transcriptional levels of mx gene in the head-kidney. Notably, peptide P4 partially inhibited viral replication in vitro at the same time-point when cells were pre-treated for 24 h, likely through modulation of host immune responses. These findings highlight the potential of targeted peptide-based therapies as a promising antiviral therapeutic strategy against NNV infections.",
