  "title": "Cardiovascular comorbidities in hospitalized patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and factors associated with a higher case-fatality rate.",
  "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited cardiac disorder, with rising hospitalization rates and high comorbidity burden, yet the impact of cardiovascular comorbidities (CVC) on mortality among hospitalized HCM patients remains poorly defined.\nQueried the 2016 to 2020 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) to identify hospitalizations with diagnosed HCM.\nAmong 278,995 HCM hospitalizations (mean age 64.3 ± 18.4 years; 55.7% female), in-hospital mortality rose from 16.4% to 22.9% throughout the study. Cardiac arrest (41.00%), tamponade (13.70%), and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (10.20%) had the highest mortality rates. Atrial fibrillation (AF) (42.10%), heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (28.10%), and cardiorenal syndrome (16.60%) were the most prevalent comorbidities. Predictors of case-fatality included increasing age (aOR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.02-1.03, p < 0.0001), Asian/Pacific Islander race (aOR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.10-2.40, p = 0.007), CVA (aOR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.70-3.06, p < 0.0001), NSTEMI (aOR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.30-2.40, p < 0.0001), cardiorenal syndrome (aOR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.20-1.80, p < 0.001), and cardiac arrest (aOR: 26.60, 95% CI: 20.90-33.90, p < 0.001).\nMortality rate among hospitalized HCM patients has shown a mild upward trend and is driven by age, race, NSTEMI, and cardiorenal syndrome.",
