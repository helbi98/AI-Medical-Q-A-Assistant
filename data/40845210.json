  "title": "Navigating uncertainty: a qualitative exploration of supply chain risks inÂ Pakistani hospitals in the post-COVID-19 era.",
  "abstract": "The post-COVID-19 era in Pakistan is marked by economic turbulence and political instability. These circumstances have significantly disrupted the supply chains of numerous industries, including healthcare. The aim of this study is to explore the supply chain risk factors faced by hospitals in the post-COVID-19 era.\nA Qualitative inductive approach was adopted for this study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 supply chain professionals working at various Pakistani hospitals. Thematic analysis was carried out, generating six main themes that impact the supply chain of the hospitals: (1) organizational risks, (2) political and regulatory risks, (3) external risks, (4) financial risks, (5) supplier risks and (6) demand risks.\nOrganizational risks, including employees' resistance to change and staff turnover, highlight the critical need for robust human resource strategies. Hospitals are particularly vulnerable to uncertain governance and economic policies, which are reflected in political and regulatory disruptions that are made worse by import bans, delays in customs clearance, strikes and communication blackouts. External risks such as counterfeit medicines, compromise patient safety and treatment outcomes. Financial risks, such as dollar rate fluctuations and tax revisions and Supplier-related risks, such as single-source supplier monopoly, further enhance the vulnerability of the supply chain.\nThe article fills the gap in the literature by adopting a qualitative approach, offering an in-depth understanding of risk factors impacting the supply chain of Pakistani hospitals. The study highlights that with the changing economic and political scenario, new risks have emerged, including political, regulatory and financial challenges, which have been largely overlooked in the previous studies. This study enriches our understanding by exploring these factors in the post-pandemic era, particularly in the context of a developing country like Pakistan.",
