  "abstract": "Aim: This study investigates the association of the TLR4 Thr399Ile (rs4986791) polymorphism with T2DM in Iraqi patients and its influence on clinical parameters.\nMaterials and Methods: A case-control study was conducted on 200 participants (100 T2DM cases and 100 healthy controls). Phenotypic analyses included fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, lipid profiles, and insulin sensitivity indices. Genotyping of the TLR4 Thr399Ile polymorphism was performed using PCR-RFLP. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS.\nResults: The CT and TT genotypes were significantly more frequent in T2DM patients, associated with higher odds ratios (OR=2.40, p=0.003; OR=5.33, p=0.04, respectively). HDL levels were significantly lower in variant genotypes (p = 0.01). Other clinical parameters showed no significant genotype-specific differences.\nConclusions: The TLR4 Thr399Ile polymorphism is significantly associated with increased T2DM risk and altered HDL levels in Iraqi patients, highlighting its potential as a genetic marker for early risk assessment.",
