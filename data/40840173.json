  "title": "Does De-Escalation of Axillary Surgery Impact Surgical Trainee Experience? A 15-Year Institutional Analysis of General Surgery Resident and Breast Surgical Oncology Fellow Operative Volumes.",
  "abstract": "To assess the impact of axillary surgery de-escalation trends on general surgery resident and breast surgical oncology fellow exposure to axillary lymph node dissection cases.\nAccreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education case logs were retrospectively analyzed with attention to change over time. Trends in axillary lymph node dissection were evaluated using univariate linear regression.\nAcademic, tertiary medical center with a large general surgery residency and multiple surgical fellowship programs.\nGeneral surgery residents and breast surgical oncology fellows graduating from 2009-2024.\nAxillary lymph node dissection experience is decreasing for general surgery residents (estimate -0.46 cases per resident/graduation year, 95% CI -0.73, -0.19; p = 0.0011), with a mean of 12.0 cases per resident graduating in 2010 versus 6.1 cases in those graduating in 2024. Sentinel lymph node experience is preserved. Fellow axillary lymph node dissection experience is stable (p = 0.20) with a mean of 21.3 cases, however more recent fellow graduates have total numbers less than 20 cases.\nThe decrease in use of axillary lymph node dissection in clinical practice parallels a decline in resident experience with axillary lymph node dissection while fellow experience appears preserved. Continued attention to trends along with intentional case assignment and alternate/supplemental methods of education, such as video and simulation, may be valuable to educate residents on axillary lymph node dissection.",
