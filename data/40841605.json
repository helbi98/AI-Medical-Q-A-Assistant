  "abstract": "Previous studies link myocardial infarction to increased stroke risk. This long-term prospective study examines stroke incidence and stroke-related mortality in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, identifying risk factors and geographic disparities.\nWe enrolled 535 ACS patients admitted to hospitals across three provinces in the Veneto region of Italy. Patients' residences were classified into three urban and three rural areas in each province. Patients were followed prospectively for 24 years or until death. Survival analysis was conducted using uni- and Multivariable Cox regression models.\nAll patients, except for three, completed the follow-up, totaling 6.151 person-years. During follow-up, 84 patients experienced a stroke, with 85% being ischemic and 15% hemorrhagic, proving fatal in 43 cases. The stroke incidence rate was 14/1.000 person-years. Older age (HR 1.84; 95% CI 1.30-2.60), atrial fibrillation (AF) (HR 2.64; 95% CI 1.49-4.67), and a higher albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) tertile (HR 1.38; 95% CI 1.04-1.83) were independent predictors of overall stroke risk, while higher estimated glomerular filtration rate tertile (eGFR) (HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.53-0.95) was independent predictor a lower risk. A sub-analysis revealed older age (HR 2.67; 95% CI 1.60-4.45) and AF (HR 2.95; 95% CI 1.38-6.32) as independent predictors of fatal stroke. Unexpectedly, we observed a higher fatal stroke risk in urban areas (HR 1.89; 95% CI 1.03-3.48) and southern provinces (HR 1.71; 95% CI 1.15-2.53).\nThis long-term cohort study reinforces the role of established clinical predictors (age, AF, renal function) in post-ACS stroke risk and highlights novel geographic disparities in fatal stroke outcomes. These findings support the integration of geographic and clinical risk stratification in long-term secondary prevention strategies.",
