  "title": "Cutoff points for sedentary behavior and their capacity to predict mortality in individuals with COPD: A 12- year follow-up study.",
  "abstract": "ObjectiveThis study aimed to identify the usefulness and compare three cutoff points of sedentary behavior (i.e., >8.5 h/day in sedentary time [ST], >70% of the awake time spent in ST, and <4300 steps/day) as predictors of all-cause mortality over a 12-years follow-up period in individuals with stable COPD.MethodsBaseline-only data from 92 individuals with COPD assessed for admission to pulmonary rehabilitation were analyzed.ResultsCox multivariate regression models identified the cutoff point of ST >8.5 h/day as an independent predictor of mortality after adjusting for confounders (hazard ratio 1.23, 95% CI 1.021 - 1.589, P = 0.02). The other two cutoffs were not significant.ConclusionAmong different cutoffs indicating sedentary behavior, ST >8.5 h/day was identified as an independent indicator of higher mortality risk in a 12-years follow-up period in individuals with stable COPD, indicating a 23% higher mortality risk in comparison to those who present ST <8.5 h/day.",
