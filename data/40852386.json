  "abstract": "Aldolase B (<i>ALDOB</i>), functioning as a glycolytic enzyme, exhibits a controversial role in malignancies and demonstrates dual potential as both a tumor suppressor and cancer-promoting enzyme. Nevertheless, it is still uncertain if there is a relationship between <i>ALDOB</i> levels, prognosis, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).\nThis study aims to investigate the prognostic significance of <i>ALDOB</i> in ccRCC and its potential association with clinicopathological features and tumor immune microenvironment. By integrating multi-database bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation, we seek to elucidate the role of <i>ALDOB</i> in ccRCC progression and its potential as a predictive biomarker.\nTo ascertain the potential link between <i>ALDOB</i> level, clinical parameters, and overall survival (OS) in individuals with ccRCC, we employed diverse databases, which include The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) and The University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer data analysis Portal (UALCAN). Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of the link between tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIIC) and <i>ALDOB</i> was carried out using the TIMER database. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was applied to identify the <i>ALDOB</i> level in a tissue microarray.\nThe expression of <i>ALDOB</i> demonstrated a strong association with pathologic T stage, pathologic N stage, pathologic M stage, histologic grade, and gender. Decreased <i>ALDOB</i> level was linked to unfavorable disease-specific survival (DSS), progress free interval (PFI), and OS outcomes (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Subsequently, a marked link was observed between <i>ALDOB</i> level and a heightened presence of infiltrating Treg, Th17 cells, and neutrophils in ccRCC. IHC showed that the <i>ALDOB</i> level in ccRCC samples was notably diminished relative to that in the adjacent normal tissues.\nAs a prospective predictive indicator for individuals with ccRCC, reduced <i>ALDOB</i> level exhibited strong correlations with clinical characteristics, unfavorable outcomes, and immune infiltration in individuals with ccRCC.",
