  "title": "Genotypic Characteristics of <i>Mycobacterium Tuberculosis</i> Based on Whole Genome Sequencing - Southern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China, 2021-2023.",
  "abstract": "Currently, <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> is classified into 9 major lineages, each exhibiting distinct geographical distribution patterns and transmission characteristics. In China, Lineage 2 predominates, while Lineage 3 is primarily distributed in the Xinjiang region.\nThis study integrated multidimensional analyses incorporating patient characteristics, strain lineages, drug resistance profiles, and transmission networks, providing a comprehensive elucidation of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> molecular epidemiology.\nMolecular epidemiological insights into <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> transmission in Southern Xinjiang enable precision tuberculosis control.",
