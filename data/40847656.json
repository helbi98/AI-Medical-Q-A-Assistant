  "title": "Brexpiprazole for agitation in clinically relevant patient subgroups: a <i>post hoc</i> analysis of efficacy and safety in patients with agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.",
  "abstract": "To explore the efficacy and safety of brexpiprazole for the treatment of agitation symptoms in clinically relevant subgroups of patients with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.\nData were pooled for brexpiprazole (2 or 3 mg/day) and placebo from two international, randomized, double-blind trials in adults with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia with mild-to-severe cognitive dysfunction and with agitation (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT01862640, NCT03548584). Change in agitation frequency over 12 weeks was measured using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). Safety measures included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). In this <i>post hoc</i> analysis, thirteen clinically relevant subgroups were investigated based on care setting (institutionalized, non-institutionalized), severity of cognitive dysfunction (mild/moderate, severe), co-occurring behavioral symptoms (psychosis, depression, anxiety, irritability, sleep disturbance), and use of concomitant medications for dementia (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, memantine) and psychiatric conditions (antidepressant, benzodiazepine).\nIn the randomized sample (N = 621), mean age was 74 years (range 55-90 years), 344 (55.4%) participants were female, and 277 (44.6%) were male. Over 12 weeks, brexpiprazole showed numerically greater reduction in agitation frequency than placebo in 12 of 13 subgroups. The only exception was 'concomitant benzodiazepines', which was a small subgroup (n = 71), but showed efficacy for brexpiprazole in secondary analyses. The largest differences in favor of brexpiprazole versus placebo were for the concomitant antidepressant, co-occurring sleep disorder, and co-occurring psychosis subgroups. The overall incidence of TEAEs was generally consistent across subgroups.\nIn these exploratory analyses, brexpiprazole reduced symptoms of agitation across a wide range of patients with agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.",
