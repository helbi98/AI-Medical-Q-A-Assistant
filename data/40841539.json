  "title": "The bispecific innate cell engager AFM28 eliminates CD123<sup>+</sup> leukemic stem and progenitor cells in AML and MDS.",
  "abstract": "Strategies targeting leukemic stem and progenitor cells (LSPCs) are needed for durable remissions in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS). While CD123 constitutes a promising target on LSPCs and leukemic blasts, previous CD123-targeting approaches showed limited efficacy and challenging safety profiles. Here, we describe the preclinical efficacy and safety of the bispecific CD123/CD16A innate cell engager \"AFM28\", demonstrating superior activity against AML and MDS patient-derived LSPCs and blasts in vitro compared to an Fc-enhanced CD123-targeting antibody, especially towards CD123<sup>low</sup> and/or CD64<sup>+</sup> leukemic cells. AFM28 induces autologous anti-leukemic activity in fresh AML whole blood cultures, demonstrating its potential to enhance NK cell function from AML patients. Responsiveness can be further enhanced by allogeneic NK cell addition. Anti-leukemic activity of AFM28 is confirmed in xenograft mouse models. In addition, AFM28 is well tolerated and demonstrates pharmacodynamic activity in cynomolgus monkeys. Altogether, our results indicate that AFM28 has the potential to reduce relapse-inducing residual disease and promote long-term remissions for patients with AML and MDS with a favorable safety profile.",
