  "title": "Current Status and Advances in Anti-Androgen Therapy for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.",
  "abstract": "The heterogeneity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has spurred the exploration of precision therapies based on molecular subtypes, with the androgen receptor (AR)-positive subtype emerging as a potential therapeutic target. The treatment of AR-positive TNBC relies primarily on androgen receptor antagonists, such as enobosarm, bicalutamide, and enzalutamide. To enhance efficacy, researchers are investigating combination therapies that integrate anti-androgen agents with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or PARP inhibitors. Additionally, studies have revealed that the AR signaling pathway regulates the tumor microenvironment, and AR inhibition may potentiate the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, anti-AR therapies face significant limitations and challenges due to multifaceted factors, necessitating further resolution. With continued advancements, AR-targeted therapy holds promise as a critical component of personalized treatment strategies for TNBC.",
