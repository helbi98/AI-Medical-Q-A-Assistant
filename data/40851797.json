  "title": "Pancreatic Metastasis From a Vulvar Melanoma Diagnosed by Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Fine-Needle Biopsy.",
  "abstract": "Vulvar melanoma (VM) is a rare and aggressive malignancy with a high metastatic potential. We present the case of an 82-year-old woman who initially presented with vaginal bleeding and was diagnosed with VM with lymph node involvement. Despite surgical and palliative interventions, she later developed brain, nodal, and pancreatic metastases. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) confirmed pancreatic metastasis through immunohistochemistry. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of pancreatic metastasis from VM diagnosed by EUS-FNB. This case highlights the importance of EUS-FNB in diagnosing metastatic lesions in unusual locations.",
