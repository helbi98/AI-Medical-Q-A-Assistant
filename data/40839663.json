  "title": "Application of <i>Ng</i>Ago-mediated genome editing in <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i>.",
  "abstract": "<i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i> is nonpathogenic and fast-growing and is usually used as a model species of <i>Mycobacterium</i>. Studying basic metabolic mechanisms is crucial for accelerating mycobacterial research. Although several tools for genome editing in <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i> MC <sup>(2)</sup> 155 (<i>M. smegmatis</i>) can be used, plasmids are difficult to construct, and the knockout efficiency is still low. Here, the <i>Ng</i>Ago system was utilized to edit the genome of the Gram-positive bacterium <i>M. smegmatis</i>, which has a high guanine-cytosine (GC) content. A shuttle plasmid containing the hsp60 promoter to drive <i>Ng</i>Ago expression was designed. PCR-mediated screening and qRTâ€’PCR confirmed that the <i>glnR</i> gene (KEGG: <i>MSMEG_5784</i>) and <i>ltmA</i> gene (KEGG: <i>MSMEG_6479</i>) were successfully knocked out by the <i>Ng</i>Ago-F system. The editing efficiency reached 80%, and the time requirement was reduced to 8 days. The optimized <i>Ng</i>Ago system establishes an efficient genome-editing platform for high-GC mycobacteria, advancing functional genomics research on <i>M. smegmatis</i> and potentially enabling precise interrogation of virulence mechanisms in pathogens, such as <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>.IMPORTANCEIn this work, we demonstrated that the <i>Ng</i>Ago system could be used to edit the genome of <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i> and has several advantages: easy plasmid construction, high editing efficiency, and short time requirements. These findings provide a powerful tool for elucidating the basic metabolic mechanisms of <i>M. smegmatis</i> and potentially those of other mycobacterial species.",
