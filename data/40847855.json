  "title": "The impact of TLR4 gene polymorphisms on the risk of developing diabetic foot syndrome in case of type 2 diabetes mellitus.",
  "abstract": "Aim: To study the effect of TLR4 gene polymorphisms (rs1927911, rs2149356 and rs4986790) on the risk of developing DFS in T2DM.\nMaterials and Methods: The study included 58 patients with T2DM who had CVD (case group) and 60 patients with T2DM who did not have CVD (control group). Genetic polymorphisms of the TLR4 gene were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction using the Gene AmpR PCR System 7500 amplifier (Applied Biosystems, USA) and TaqMan Mutation Detection Assays Life-Technology (USA). MedStat and MedCalc v.15.1 software packages (MedCalc Software bvba) were used for statistical analysis.\nResults: The analysis of the frequency of genotypes and alleles of rs1927911 showed an increase in the ancestral homozygote G/G (pFet = 0.022) with a decrease in the frequency of the heterozygote G/A (pFet = 0.025) and the minor allele A (pFet = 0.042). The rs1927911 allele polymorphism reduced the risk of developing SBS (p=0.040; OR=0.516; 95% CI 0.274-0.974). The rs2149356 polymorphism was not associated with the development of CVD in patients with T2D. In addition, an increase in the frequency of the minor G/G rs4986790 homozygote (pFet = 0.026) and the minor G allele (pFet = 0.047) was shown in patients with CVD. The rs4986790 allele polymorphism increased the risk of developing SIDS (p=0.047; OR=2.4; 95% CI 0.994-5.812).\nConclusions: The prospects of genotyping TLR4 gene polymorphisms have been shown and the dependence of the risk of CVD on the polymorphic state of rs1927911 and rs4986790 in patients with T2DM from the Ukrainian population has been confirmed.",
