  "title": "Advances and Future Perspectives for the Management of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in Australia: A Narrative Review.",
  "abstract": "Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in Australia, with diagnoses projected to rise further following the introduction of the National Lung Cancer Screening Program in July 2025. Comprehensive molecular profiling has become central to the management of non-small cell lung cancer, enabling tailored therapies such as chemoimmunotherapy, immunotherapy, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors in perioperative, adjuvant, and palliative settings. With the emergence of perioperative systemic therapies and novel agents for the management of metastatic disease, there is a need to ensure that equitable care is delivered across Australia. Further investment in oncology workforce expansion and planning is critical to meet growing demands. In this narrative review, we explore the rapidly evolving landscape of available therapeutics for managing patients with early and advanced NSCLC in the Australian context, highlight the emerging treatment options being investigated in ongoing clinical trials, and discuss future considerations for clinical practice.",
