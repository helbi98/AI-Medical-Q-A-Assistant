  "title": "Safety of the 6-minute walk test in adults with severe asthma.",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the safety of 6-minute walk test (6MWT) in people with severe asthma compared with non-severe asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and healthy controls. Secondly, we sought to compare 6MWT outcomes between adults with severe asthma receiving monoclonal antibody therapy (mAb) or not.\nA total of 403 participants (severe asthma n=175; non-severe asthma n=64; COPD n=99; controls n=65) underwent a cross-sectional multidimensional assessment that included a 6MWT. Groups were compared regarding adverse events, limiting factors, and physiological responses during the 6MWT.\nParticipants with severe asthma, mostly female (65%), with an average (median [quartile1, quartile3]) age of 60 [45,69] years and BMI of 31 [26,37] kg/m<sup>2</sup> showed no adverse events during the 6MWT, irrespective of mAb treatment. The proportion of participants who rested during 6MWT was similar between participants with severe (10%) and non-severe asthma (9%), but lower than those with COPD (23%). The severe asthma group experienced greater breathlessness from the 6MWT compared with non-severe asthma and controls (p<0.001). Fewer participants with severe asthma had SpO<sub>2</sub> decrease to <85% during the test compared with COPD (3% vs 14%, p<0.05). No differences in the 6MWT distance were observed between mAb-treated or non-treated severe asthma participants (p=0.13). Those receiving mAb therapy did not report respiratory limitations during the test.\nThe 6MWT is safe for adults with severe asthma when pre-bronchodilation is provided and SpO<sub>2</sub> <85% is used as a stopping criterion. Participants treated or not with mAb achieved comparable 6MWT distances.",
