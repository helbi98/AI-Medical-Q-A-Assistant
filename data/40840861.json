  "title": "Artificial intelligence biomarker detects high-risk childhood asthma subgroup for respiratory infections and exacerbations.",
  "abstract": "Asthma is associated with an increased risk of acute respiratory infections (ARI). Little is known about whether natural language processing (NLP)-powered digital biomarkers can identify a high-risk asthma subgroup for ARI during early childhood.\nWe assessed whether a digital biomarker could identify a high-risk subgroup of childhood asthma for ARI.\nWe applied validated NLP algorithms for Predetermined Asthma Criteria (NLP-PAC) and Asthma Predictive Index (NLP-API) to electronic health records of the 1997-2016 Mayo Clinic Birth Cohort. We categorized the cohort into 4 subgroups: both criteria positive (NLP<sup>-</sup>PAC<sup>+</sup>/NLP<sup>-</sup>API<sup>+</sup>), PAC positive only (NLP<sup>-</sup>PAC<sup>+</sup>), API positive only (NLP<sup>-</sup>API<sup>+</sup>), and both criteria negative (NLP<sup>-</sup>PAC<sup>-</sup>/NLP<sup>-</sup>API<sup>-</sup>). We assessed the risk of 5 medically attended ARI (pneumonia, frequent group A streptococcal pharyngeal infection, Bordetella pertussis, influenza A/B, and respiratory syncytial virus infection) and asthma exacerbation defined by NLP algorithms at 3 years of age among the 4 subgroups. We also examined whether such associations emerged during the first 3 years of life.\nThere were 22,370 eligible subjects (51% male and 81% White). The NLP<sup>-</sup>PAC<sup>+</sup>/NLP<sup>-</sup>API<sup>+</sup> subgroup had the highest risk of pneumonia, influenza A/B, and asthma exacerbation compared to other groups. No significant differences were found in other ARI. The same subgroup had the highest occurrence of pneumonia, influenza A/B, and respiratory syncytial virus infection, compared to other groups, during the first 3 years of life.\nNLP<sup>-</sup>PAC<sup>+</sup>/NLP<sup>-</sup>API<sup>+</sup> can be a novel digital biomarker for a high-risk subgroup of childhood asthma for pneumonia, influenza A/B, and asthma exacerbation. This phenotype may emerge early in life.",
