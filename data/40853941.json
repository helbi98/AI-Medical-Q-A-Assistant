  "title": "The emerging role of milk-derived extracellular vesicles in gut pathology and cancer management.",
  "abstract": "Milk extracellular vesicles (mEVs) are emerging as important mediators in gut pathology and cancer management. These stable nanoscale vesicles contain bioactive cargos including microRNAs, proteins, and lipids that facilitate intercellular communication and offer therapeutic opportunities.\nThis review examines mEVs' role in gut health and cancer therapy, synthesizing recent evidence from 2021 to 2025 across various milk sources (camel, bovine, equine, ovine, human).\nmEVs significantly enhance intestinal health by strengthening epithelial barriers, modulating immune responses, and improving gut microbiota composition. In colitis models, they reduce inflammation, improve intestinal integrity, and restore microbial balance. Additionally, mEVs show promising cancer treatment applications, functioning as natural anticancer agents and efficient drug delivery vehicles. Their biocompatibility, tumor-targeting capabilities, and ability to enhance therapeutic efficacy while reducing toxicity address key limitations of conventional therapies. mEVs represent a promising frontier in preventive and therapeutic interventions for gastrointestinal disorders and cancer, positioning them as valuable candidates for future clinical applications in food-based therapeutics and precision medicine.",
