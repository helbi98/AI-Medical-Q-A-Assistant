  "abstract": "To evaluate the clinical efficacy of press needle exercise therapy for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nSixty patients with stable COPD were randomly assigned to an observation group (30 cases, 1 case dropped out) and a control group (30 cases, 2 cases dropped out). Basic treatment was applied to the two groups. The control group received pulmonary rehabilitation training, while the observation group received press needle exercise therapy. Press needle was applied at Dazhui (GV14), Danzhong (CV17), Qihai (CV6), Guanyuan (CV4), Zhiyang (GV9) and bilateral Feishu (BL13), Gaohuang (BL43), Jueyinshu (BL14), Xinshu (BL15), Geshu (BL17), Pishu (BL20), Shenshu (BL23). During the press needle intervention, patients also underwent pulmonary rehabilitation training. Treatments were administered once every other day, three times a week, for 8 weeks. Pulmonary function indexes including forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), FEV1 to forced vital capacity ratio (FEV1/FVC), and percentage of predicted FEV1 (FEV1%) were measured before and after treatment in the two groups. Additional assessments included the 6-minute walk test (6 MWT) and COPD assessment test (CAT) score. Clinical efficacy was also compared between the two groups.\nAfter treatment, both groups showed improvements in FEV1, FEV1/FVC, FEV1%, and 6 MWT (<i>P</i><0.05), and reductions in CAT scores (<i>P</i><0.05); the observation group showed higher FEV1, FEV1/FVC, FEV1%, and 6 MWT values, and lower CAT scores compared to those in the control group (<i>P</i><0.05). The total effective rate in the observation group was 86.2% (25/29), higher than 60.7% (17/28) in the control group (<i>P</i><0.05).\nPress needle exercise therapy could effectively alleviate clinical symptoms, improve pulmonary function and exercise tolerance, and enhance quality of life in patients with stable COPD.",
