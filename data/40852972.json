  "title": "Optimization of Novel Quinazolines as Potent Aurora Kinase Inhibitors for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Treatment.",
  "abstract": "This work describes the discovery of a new series of Aurora kinase inhibitors based on quinazoline skeleton derived from <b>ENMD-2076</b>, as well as the first X-ray cocrystal structure complexes of vinyl-quinazoline <b>9h</b> with Aurora A. Replacing pyrimidine with quinazoline improved anticancer activity and facilitated cocrystal formation. Compounds <b>9a</b> and <b>9h</b> showed excellent Aurora A kinase inhibition, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 6.0 and 2.8 nM, respectively. <b>9h</b> demonstrated superior activity against TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 48 nM and achieved 59% tumor growth inhibition in xenograft models, vs <b>ENMD-2076</b>'s 33% with no observable toxicity. Mechanistic studies using immunoblotting, immunofluorescence staining, and flow cytometry showed that <b>9h</b> outperforms <b>ENMD-2076</b> in inhibiting Aurora A kinase activation, preventing spindle formation, arresting the cell cycle, and inducing cell apoptosis. Thus, <b>9h</b> has the potential for further optimization and is a promising anticancer drug candidate.",
