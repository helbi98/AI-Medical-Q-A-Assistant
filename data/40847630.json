  "title": "Crisis Preparedness and Systemic Risk: The Role of Municipal Leaders in Disaster Risk Governance in Norway.",
  "abstract": "This study explores how Norwegian leaders in rural municipalities attend to disaster risk governance and prepare for resilient response to threats from systemic, interconnected, and cascading hazards. Systemic risk management in the Norwegian municipalities will depend on the context and how critical organizational processes are managed by the municipal leaders. Following the COVID-19 pandemic and an increased awareness of climate-related threats, 12 Norwegian municipal leaders (7 men and 5 women) participated in semi-structured interviews on crisis management and disaster risk preparedness in their municipality. The analysis identified three main themes: (a) Facing the unknown: addressing their emotional perception of risk, responsibilities, and the constant struggle to balance their everyday tasks and prioritize crisis preparedness; (b) Procedures are needed but relations are key: pointing to the need for collaboration, the value of trust, and to maintain good interpersonal relations; (c) We need to train: acknowledging the value of training and crisis preparedness in searching for viable ways to prepare for the unexpected. The study underscores the role of municipal leaders and highlights the value of interpersonal relations and trust when faced with decision dilemmas, uncertainty, and training needs in local disaster risk governance.",
