  "title": "Association of T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 gene (TIM3) polymorphism with susceptibility and severity of Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease: a prospective study in Taiwan.",
  "abstract": "Patients with Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease (MAC-LD) may exhibit immune exhaustion characterized by elevated T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (TIM3) expression on T lymphocytes. Whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in TIM3 genes are associated with susceptibility to MAC-LD and its clinical presentation remains unknown.\nMAC-LD patients and controls were recruited to assess associations between three TIM3 gene SNPs and MAC-LD susceptibility and severity. Disease extent was evaluated using a radiographic score. TIM3-expressing CD4⁺ T cells in peripheral blood were quantified by flow cytometry.\nHigher proportions of TIM3 rs13170556 TC+CC genotype (33% vs. 22%, p=0.042) and females (66% vs. 53%, p=0.037) were found in the MAC-LD group (n=135) than in controls (n=139), both independently associated with MAC-LD (odds ratio [OR], 1.752 [95% confidence interval,1.015-3.025], p=0.044 and 1.746 [1.068-2.852], p=0.026). Among patients, the TIM3 rs13170556 polymorphism was associated with sputum-smear grading >2+ and radiographic scores >5 (OR 2.183 [1.016-4.694], p=0.046, and 1.960 [1.023-3.755], p=0.043). The proportion of TIM3-expressing CD4+ T cells was higher in patients with TIM3 rs13170556 TC+CC genotypes compared to TT genotype (7.1±7.6% vs. 4.3±3.4%; p=0.067) (n=75).\nTIM3 rs13170556 polymorphism is associated with MAC-LD and disease severity, potentially through increased TIM3 expression on CD4+ T cells.",
