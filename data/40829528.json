  "title": "The current landscape and challenges of narrative nursing in managing negative emotions among chronically ill older adults: A literature review.",
  "abstract": "This review aims to analyze the effectiveness of narrative nursing in alleviating negative emotions among elderly patients with chronic diseases, with the objective of providing a reference for future research on narrative nursing interventions.\nA scoping review based on the principles of participants, concept and context (PCC).\nBased on the principles of Person-Centered Care (PCC), this study reviews the prevalence of narrative nursing and its effects on elderly patients with chronic illnesses.\nA total of 21 papers were included in this review, indicating that narrative nursing had a positive effect on improving negative emotions such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and self-efficacy in elderly patients with chronic diseases. The types of chronic diseases addressed include cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic heart failure, and stroke.\nChina's aging population and the rising prevalence of chronic diseases underscore the value of narrative nursing in elderly care. This approach aids in alleviating symptoms, improving mental health, and enhancing treatment adherence. However, current barriers include limited staff training and the absence of standardized protocols. Prioritizing skill development and creating tailored guidelines could facilitate greater clinical adoption of narrative nursing.\nA comprehensive summary of the concept and core technologies of narrative nursing deepens the understanding of its mechanisms of action. Additionally, this synthesis elucidates its effects on alleviating negative emotions in elderly patients with chronic diseases. Such insights provide a theoretical foundation for the formulation of intervention strategies designed to prevent and mitigate negative emotions in this demographic.",
