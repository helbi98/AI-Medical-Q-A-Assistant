  "title": "Host proteins interacting with integrase of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.",
  "abstract": "Integrase (IN) is a key enzyme that catalyzes the integration of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) viral DNA into the human genome. It consists of three domains: the N-terminal domain, the catalytic core domain, and the C-terminal domain. In the cytoplasm, IN, viral DNA, and multiple host factors assemble into a pre-integration complex (PIC). The translocation of PIC from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is a prerequisite for integration. Numerous host proteins modulate IN activity during PIC translocation and the integration process. Interactions between IN and host factors represent promising targets for treating HIV infection. In this study, we summarize advances in research on HIV integrase interactors. These findings may enhance our understanding of HIV infection and facilitate the development of integrase-targeted therapeutics.",
