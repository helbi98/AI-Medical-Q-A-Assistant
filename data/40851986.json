  "title": "Spindle cell carcinoma of the lung with myogenic differentiation in a young female patient: a rare case report.",
  "abstract": "Spindle cell carcinoma is a sporadic sarcomatoid neoplasm in the lung and pleura, comprising only 0.3-1.3% of all malignant lung neoplasms. This case highlights a rare case of aggressive spindle cell carcinoma in a young female patient with no risk factor.\nA 20-year-old female patient with no other comorbidities presented with a chronic cough associated with hemoptysis and right-sided chest pain off and off. Auscultation of the lungs revealed decreased breath sounds over the left lung. X-ray chest and computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest showed a round homogenous opacity in the left lung. A biopsy of the mass confirmed the diagnosis of spindle cell carcinoma with focal myogenic differentiation and infarctive necrosis.\nSpindle cell carcinoma is often difficult to diagnose histologically as it usually shows pleomorphism, exhibits minor differentiation, and includes components such as sarcoma, fusiform, or giant cells.\nDiagnosing spindle cell carcinoma of the lung could be challenging, especially in young patients with no other risk factors.",
