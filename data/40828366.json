  "title": "Optimizing HCV Management Among Rohingya Refugees in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh: Addressing Cofactors and Environmental Risks to Mitigate Long-Term Liver Disease Complications.",
  "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is increasingly reported among Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar, with active infection rates in adults reaching 20% by 2023. The risk of liver disease progression and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may be amplified by coexisting factors such as chronic malnutrition, coinfections, aflatoxin exposure, metabolic disorders, and environmental toxins. Despite WHO-led efforts, data on these risk factors remain fragmented, and access to care is limited. This study underscores the need for comprehensive surveillance, epidemiological research, and long-term prevention strategies to reduce HCV-related morbidity and the future burden of HCC in displaced Rohingya populations.",
