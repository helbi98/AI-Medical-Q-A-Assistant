  "title": "Provider Factors Likely to Impact Access and Uptake of Long-Acting Injectable Cabotegravir for Transgender Women in the United States: Results of a Qualitative Study.",
  "abstract": "Long-acting injectable cabotegravir (CAB-LA) was US Food and Drug Administration-approved in 2021. However, little is known about providers' CAB-LA knowledge, attitudes, challenges, and prescribing preferences for transgender women patients. Understanding this is critical to developing new pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) interventions tailored to transgender women. We conducted 45-min, in-depth Zoom interviews (IDIs) with United States-based health care providers who prescribe PrEP to transgender women. IDIs focused on providers' CAB-LA knowledge/acceptability, willingness to prescribe CAB-LA to transgender women, potential challenges, and solutions to mitigate challenges. Providers (N = 17) had a mean age of 43 years, and 35.4% (n = 6) identified as people of color. Most (n = 12) had basic knowledge of CAB-LA but wanted additional training. All participants found CAB-LA acceptable and were willing to prescribe. Most (n = 11) anticipated minimal challenges to implementation. Others (n = 4) reported potential issues, including logistical/scheduling concerns that impede CAB-LA integration and staffing concerns. Many providers expressed support for self-injection (n = 13) and injections at \"drop-in\" clinics (n = 8) to overcome challenges.",
