  "title": "Prognostic Value of Intravascular Optical Coherence Tomography in Patients With Coronary Heart Disease Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.",
  "abstract": "We aimed to ascertain the predictive value of intravascular optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the prognosis of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\nIndependent factors affecting major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and predictive efficacy of OCT parameters on MACE in CHD patients were analyzed.\nAdvanced age and large lipid arc degree were risk factors for MACE occurrence (OR > 1, p < 0.05), while thick fibrous cap thickness and high left ventricular ejection fraction were protective (OR < 1, p < 0.05). Fibrous cap thickness predicted MACE (AUC 0.765, 95% CI 0.690 ~ 0.840, cut-off 92 μm); lipid arc degree did as well (AUC 0.885, 95% CI 0.817 ~ 0.952, cut-off 214.5°).\nOCT supports interventional treatment in CHD patients, with fibrous cap thickness and lipid arc degree demonstrating some prognostic predictive value post-PCI.",
