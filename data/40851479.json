  "abstract": "<i>EGFR</i> exon 20 insertions account for 1% to 10% of <i>EGFR</i> mutations in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and are known to confer resistance to traditional tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, the prognostic significance of these mutations in early-stage resected NSCLC remains unclear. This study assesses outcomes in patients with resected NSCLC harboring <i>EGFR</i> exon 20 insertions, comparing them to patients with common <i>EGFR</i> mutations and those with wild-type <i>EGFR</i>.\nWe retrospectively reviewed 3,235 patients who underwent resection for NSCLC at Tri-Service Hospital between 2008 and 2021. After excluding cases lacking <i>EGFR</i> testing, incomplete data, or advanced-stage disease, 44 patients with exon 20 insertions were matched to 602 patients with common <i>EGFR</i> mutations and 729 with wild-type <i>EGFR</i>. Clinical characteristics, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, with statistical comparisons performed using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify independent prognostic factors.\nPatients with exon 20 insertions were younger and more frequently presented with stage IA disease. The 5-year DFS was 79% in the exon 20 insertion group, compared to 81% in the common mutation group and 83.9% in the wild-type group. The 5-year OS was 78.5% for exon 20, 91.9% for common mutations, and 91% for wild-type. While no significant differences in DFS or OS were observed between groups, the exon 20 insertion group had a higher incidence of secondary cancers. Multivariable analysis indicated that exon 20 insertion was independently associated with worse OS, but not with DFS.\n<i>EGFR</i> exon 20 insertions do not significantly shorten DFS, but are associated with inferior OS in early-stage resected NSCLC. Given the limited treatment options, the role of adjuvant therapy warrants further investigation.",
