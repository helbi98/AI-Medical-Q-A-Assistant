  "abstract": "Aim: to determine the frequency and peculiarities of the clinical course of GD in patients with MAFLD depending on body mass index (BMI).\nMaterials and Methods: 324 patients with MAFLD were examined. At the first stage of the study, the frequency of GD in patients with MAFLD was determined. At the second stage of the study, the features of the clinical course of GD in patients with MAFLD were assessed.\nResults: The analysis of the results of ultrasound examination of the abdominal cavity indicates a high incidence of GD in patients with MAFLD, namely in 117 (36.1 %) patients. In accordance with the aim of our study, patients were divided into 2 groups: group I (n=117) included patients with MAFLD and GD; group II included patients with MAFLD without GD (n=207). In patients with MAFLD and grade II obesity, mainly calculi larger than 10.0 mm were diagnosed. In patients with normal body weight, as well as with excessive body weight, calculi up to 5.0 mm in size are more often detected.\nConclusions: In 36.1 % of patients with MAFLD, gallbladder disease was detected. In patients with MAFLD, with the progression of obesity, a decrease in the size of gallstones was found.",
