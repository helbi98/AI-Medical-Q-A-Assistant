  "title": "Digital Support for Complex Interventions in Psychiatric Nursing: Implementation Models and Effectiveness Evaluation.",
  "abstract": "Digital technologies are increasingly integrated into psychiatric nursing, yet a comprehensive understanding of their implementation and effectiveness remains limited. This bibliometric analysis explored the research landscape of digitally-supported interventions, focusing on models, effectiveness, and future directions. A systematic search of the Web of Science Core Collection (2019-2024) was conducted, combining bibliometric mapping with thematic analysis. Four thematic clusters emerged: (1) Digital Psychiatry and m-Health Applications, (2) Simulation and VR in Nursing Education, (3) Telemedicine and Mental Health in the COVID-19 Era, and (4) Foundational Concepts of Digital Mental Health. m-Health applications were central themes, while telemedicine's role was crucial during the pandemic. The study highlights the importance of digital technologies, especially m-health, in psychiatric nursing and underscores the need to enhance nurses' digital skills and develop effective nurse-led interventions. The analysis also identifies critical research gaps concerning clinically meaningful outcomes, cost-effectiveness, transferability, and patient/provider experiences. These findings provide a roadmap for future investigations to improve patient care.",
