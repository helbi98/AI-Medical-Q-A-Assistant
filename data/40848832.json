  "title": "Cat, dog and exotic animal allergy.",
  "abstract": "Cats and dogs are the primary and most common sources of indoor allergens from domestic animals. These allergens are mainly found in saliva, epithelium, and hair and are dispersed in the air as small particles. They are detected in schools and homes even without cats or dogs, transported attached to fomites and people in contact with these animals. Allergy to exotic pets, such as gerbils, guinea pigs, ferrets, iguanas, and others also exists, especially in a day and age when 68% and 38% families in the United States and Europe, respectively, have a pet in their home. This document is intended to be a tool to aid decision-making by professionals who care for people who suffer from dog, cat, or exotic animal allergies, to establish diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, and to improve the patient's quality of life.",
