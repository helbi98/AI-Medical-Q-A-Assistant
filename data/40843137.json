  "title": "An Outbreak of Isoniazid-Resistant Tuberculosis in a School Originating from Household Transmission - Guigang City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, November 2024.",
  "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) represents one of the world's most significant infectious diseases, caused by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>M. tuberculosis</i>). The pathogen spreads readily among students due to crowded environments and prolonged close contact during school activities.\nThis outbreak investigation identified 18 TB cases (15 students, 1 teacher, and 2 staff members), including 5 cases with isoniazid-resistant TB. Sixteen pulmonary TB cases demonstrated clear epidemiological linkage, indicating a clustered outbreak spanning multiple households, school grades, and both junior and senior high schools.\nThis outbreak underscores the critical importance of comprehensive household contact screening. When tuberculosis emerges within a family unit, school contacts - particularly students and teachers - require immediate and thorough screening. Additionally, the outbreak reveals significant gaps in the effectiveness and quality of entrance physical examinations that demand urgent improvement.",
