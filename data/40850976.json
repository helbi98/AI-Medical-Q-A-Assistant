  "abstract": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), derived from circulating monocytes recruited to tumor sites via chemotactic signals such as C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) and colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), are pivotal components of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Functionally polarized into distinct subtypes, TAMs play dual roles: proinflammatory M1-type TAMs enhance antitumor immunity through the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-12 (IL-12) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and direct tumor cell cytotoxicity, whereas M2-type TAMs promote tumor progression by facilitating angiogenesis, metastasis, and immunosuppression. This polarization is dynamically regulated by different cytokines, various signaling pathways, and metabolic cues within the TME. Spatial distribution analyses revealed that M2-like TAMs predominantly infiltrate hypoxic and stromal regions, where they secrete factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to remodel the extracellular matrix and suppress immune responses via programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and arginase-1 upregulation. Crucially, TAMs interact extensively with immune cells; M2-TAMs secrete interleukin-10 (IL-10) and TGF-β to inhibit cytotoxic T lymphocytes while expanding regulatory T (Treg) cells and impairing natural killer (NK) cell function via altered antigen presentation. Conversely, M1-TAMs synergize with dendritic cells to enhance T-cell priming. Therapeutically, targeting TAMs offers promising strategies, including colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitors, CCL2 antagonists, and nanoparticle-mediated repolarization of M2-TAMs toward the M1 phenotype. Emerging genetic approaches, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) editing, aim to disrupt protumorigenic pathways in TAMs. Additionally, TAM-related biomarkers (e.g., CD206 and CD163) are being evaluated for their prognostic and predictive utility in immunotherapies. Despite progress, challenges persist owing to TAM plasticity and TME heterogeneity across cancers. This review synthesizes TAM biology, immune crosstalk, and therapeutic advancements, providing a foundation for novel oncology strategies aimed at reprogramming TAMs to overcome treatment resistance and improve clinical outcomes.",
