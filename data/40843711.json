  "title": "Identification of Cancer-Associated Proteins in Colorectal Cancer Using Mass Spectrometry.",
  "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with a multifactorial etiology involving genetic and environmental factors. Advanced proteomics offers valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of cancer, identifying proteins that function as mediators in tumor biology.\nIn this study, we used mass spectrometry-based data-independent acquisition (DIA) to analyze the proteomic landscape of CRC. We compared protein abundance in normal and tumor tissues from 16 patients with CRC to identify cancer-associated proteins and examine their roles in disease progression.\nThe analysis identified 10,329 proteins, including 531 cancer-associated proteins from the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) database, and 48 proteins specifically linked to CRC. Notably, clusters of proteins showed consistent increases or decreases in abundance across disease stages, suggesting their roles in tumorigenesis and progression.\nOur findings suggest that proteome abundance trends may contribute to the identification of biomarker candidates and therapeutic targets in colorectal cancer. However, given the limited sample size and lack of subtype stratification, further studies using larger, statistically powered cohorts are warranted to establish clinical relevance. These proteins may provide insights into drug resistance and tumor heterogeneity. Limitations of the study include the inability to detect low-abundance proteins and reliance on protein abundance rather than functional activity. Future complementary approaches, such as affinity proteomics, are suggested to address these limitations.",
