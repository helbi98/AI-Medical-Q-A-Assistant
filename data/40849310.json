  "title": "New perspectives on molecular mechanisms underlying exercise-induced benefits in Parkinson's disease.",
  "abstract": "Exercise offers neuroprotective benefits in Parkinson's disease (PD) by enhancing neurotrophic factors (e.g., BDNF, GDNF), improving mitochondrial function, reducing inflammation, and promoting autophagy. Irisin, a muscle-derived cytokine, links exercise to neuronal health by regulating mitochondria and mitigating oxidative stress. Notably, irisin may serve as a therapeutic target for patients unable to exercise. Thus, exercise is a promising non-pharmacological intervention warranting further research for novel PD therapies.",
