  "title": "Evidence of the Efficacy of Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors in In Vivo Studies: A Systematic Review.",
  "abstract": "This systematic review aimed to provide an updated overview of studies using anticholinesterases with in vivo activity for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\nA systematic review was conducted using searches in the following databases: PubMed, SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online), Web of Science, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Literature in Health Sciences), as well as gray literature, through the CAPES and Google Scholar databases of national and international journals. The research was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) platform under registration number: CRD42024482117 and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol.\nA total of 1,191 articles were identified in the databases, of which 11 were selected to compose this systematic review, as they met the previously pre-defined selection criteria. The selected articles were published between 2019 and 2023. The substance most commonly used to induce Alzheimer's was scopolamine. As for administration routes, the most used was intraperitoneal. Some of the methods used to evaluate cognitive processes in rats and mice were- Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), Morris water maze (MWZ), Y maze, and passive avoidance tests.\nThe reviewed studies demonstrated that the evaluated anticholinesterase agents exhibited anti-Alzheimer activity in animal models, with notable cognitive effects observed in behavioral tests.\nThe data indicated that the analyzed anticholinesterase agents have therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's disease, justifying the continuation of preclinical research and future clinical investigations.",
