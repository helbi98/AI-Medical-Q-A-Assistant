  "title": "Immune logics, immune selves and immunoprivilege in the COVID era: Perspectives from marginalised social groups.",
  "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by a fraught immunopolitics in which the health and interests of powerful social groups have been privileged, supported and valued while members of disadvantaged groups have been positioned as both more vulnerable and expendable. This article identifies logics about immune selves ('immune logics') among marginalised Australian sub-groups who have historically been subjected to discrimination and social stigma. The study involved 30 semi-structured interviews with LGBTIQA + people and people living with the blood-borne viruses hepatitis B, hepatitis C or the human immunodeficiency virus. Findings are structured under three main immune logics: i) logics of relative immunity; ii) logics of COVID vulnerability; and iii) logics of immunoprivilege. The study demonstrates how these logics are relational and dynamic, situated in time, place and social structures, and constantly responding to these conditions. Factors beyond stigma, racialisation or socioeconomic disadvantage may contribute to immunoprivilege, often in complicated ways. Immunoprivilege was viewed as established through individual behaviours and via access to quality healthcare and regular monitoring of chronic infections and other health conditions, as well as to vaccines and therapies such as antivirals and gender-affirming care.",
