  "abstract": "Loss of MTAP serves as a potential predictive marker of response to cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors and as negative predictor of response to immune-checkpoint inhibitors. We investigated the prevalence of MTAP deficiency by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in NSCLC as a surrogate for MTAP loss.\nMTAP IHC was performed on 698 NSCLC samples. Data from routine next-generation sequencing, analyzed with the Oncomine<sup>TM</sup> Precision Assay (OPA-NGS, Thermo Fisher), were available in 426 cases, including CDKN2A copy number variation (CNV) data in 411 cases. Our findings were compared to data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).\nMTAP deficiency by IHC was found in 18.2% of NSCLC. CDKN2A loss by OPA-NGS - used as a surrogate for MTAP loss - was significantly associated with MTAP deficiency by IHC, but was found in only 28.4% of the MTAP deficient NSCLC analyzed for CDKN2A CNV. In the TCGA cohort, only 72.9% of NSCLC with CDKN2A loss had a concurrent MTAP loss defined by CNV.\nMTAP IHC seems to be better suited than OPA-NGS to assess the MTAP status in NSCLC, especially as the MTAP gene is not specifically covered within this panel. CDKN2A loss is not a reliable MTAP loss surrogate, as it overestimated MTAP loss in more than 25% of the cases in the TCGA cohort.",
