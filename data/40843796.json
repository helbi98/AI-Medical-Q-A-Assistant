  "title": "Dermatopathological Challenges in Objectively Characterizing Immunotherapy Response in Mycosis Fungoides.",
  "abstract": "In this review, we explore the complexities of objectively assessing the response to immunotherapy in mycosis fungoides (MF), a prevalent form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The core challenge lies in distinguishing between reactive and malignant lymphocytes amidst treatment, particularly given the absence of uniform pathological biomarkers for MF. We highlight the vital role of emerging histological technologies, such as multispectral imaging and spatial transcriptomics, in offering a more profound insight into the tumor microenvironment (TME) and its dynamic response to immunomodulatory therapies. Drawing on parallels with melanoma-another immunogenic skin cancer-our review suggests that methodologies and insights from melanoma could be instrumental in refining the approach to MF. We specifically focus on the prognostic implications of various TME cell types, including CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and histiocytes, in predicting therapy responses. The review culminates in a discussion about adapting and evolving treatment response quantification strategies from melanoma research to the distinct context of MF, advocating for the implementation of novel techniques like high-throughput T-cell receptor gene rearrangement analysis. This exploration underscores the urgent need for continued innovation and standardization in evaluating responses to immunotherapies in MF, a field rapidly evolving with new therapeutic strategies.",
