  "abstract": "BackgroundRates of sexually transmitted and blood borne infections (STBBI) are rapidly increasing. Despite the high diagnostic accuracy of self-testing, no fully remote STBBI testing programs are available in Canada. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a fully-remote, web-based, at-home STBBI testing (self-collection) program in Calgary, Canada.MethodsParticipants who were Alberta residents aged ≥16 years self-enrolled into a web-based platform between February 2023 and March 2024 and completed consent and intake questionnaires consisting of demographic and sexual health data. Kits were mailed, and samples were self-collected including swabs, urine and dried blood spot cards. Results of processed kits were communicated securely to participants. Surveys to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the process were completed.ResultsOf the 156 participants (39.7% men, 37.3 ± 10.5 years) from diverse sex and gender backgrounds who completed the intake, 43% (<i>n</i> = 67) participants returned their testing kits. In the cohort, there was low reported condom use in more than 50%, and 40% had not had STBBI testing in the past 12 months. There were six participants (9.0%) with new positive tests for an STBBI and all were connected with appropriate treatment. Participants largely reported satisfaction with the web-based platform and testing process as well as ease with testing modalities with the except for dried blood spot testing which presented collection challenges.ConclusionsOur web-based comprehensive testing pilot was feasible and acceptable, demonstrating the value of such remote approaches to diminishing the threat of rising STBBI rates.",
