  "title": "Urinary levels and estimated daily intake of phthalates and phenols in kidney transplanted Norwegian children.",
  "abstract": "Kidney transplanted children are exposed to phthalates and phenols, potentially harmful environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Urinary levels of phthalates and phenols in 52 Norwegian kidney transplanted children were compared with levels in healthy children, in children with chronic kidney disease, evaluated against selected variables, and where estimated daily intakes (EDIs) were back-calculated and assessed as part of a risk assessment. Urine samples were collected at a mean age of 11.6 (range 2.3-18) years, after a median of five (range 1.0-15.5) years after the transplant. Kidney transplanted Norwegian children's urinary levels of phthalates and phenols showed a broad range between minimum and maximum levels, with lower levels measured in older children and as time passed after the transplant. Most levels of phthalate metabolites were lower, however 2-5 times higher for the sum of (∑) di-iso-nonyl phthalate (DiNP) metabolites, methylparaben, propylparaben (PrPa), and triclosan, compared to other Norwegian children with presumed normal kidney function. Girls had higher concentrations of monoethyl phthalate, with no differences observed among children with or without overweight or hypertension. The risk assessment showed that at least 10 % of children were at risk of adverse health effects due to PrPa exposure, as well as a few children at maximum exposure to metabolites of ∑DiNP, and to ∑ di-n-butyl phthalate, butyl benzyl phthalate, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and DiNP. All included kidney transplanted children had EDI above the threshold value for bisphenol A, suggesting that this widely used chemical may pose a health risk to this patient group.
