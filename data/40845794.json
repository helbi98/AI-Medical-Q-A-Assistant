  "abstract": "This article examines the experiment conducted by Johannes Theodor Wilhelm Petruschky (1863-1945) on the eradication of tuberculosis using tuberculin. His research was inspired by the work of Robert Koch, who discovered the etiological agent of tuberculosis and conducted experiments using tuberculin as a therapeutic agent. Despite initial hopes, tuberculin proved ineffective in treating tuberculosis. Following Koch's ideas, Petruschky conducted studies in Gda≈Ñsk and later in the isolated community of Hel, where he attempted to eliminate tuberculosis through systematic diagnosis and prevention. He declared the experiment a success, claiming that Hel had become tuberculosis-free. However, his research faced criticism, particularly from Ernst Effler, who questioned the reliability of the epidemiological data. Ultimately, Petruschky's method did not stand the test of time, and his claims of successful eradication were discredited. Nevertheless, his model of patient surveillance contributed to the development of tuberculosis control systems.",
