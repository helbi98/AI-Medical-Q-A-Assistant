  "title": "Understanding monocyte-driven neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease using human cortical organoid microphysiological systems.",
  "abstract": "Increasing evidence strongly links neuroinflammation to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Peripheral monocytes are crucial components of the human immune system, but their contribution to AD pathogenesis is still largely understudied partially due to limited human models. Here, we introduce human cortical organoid microphysiological systems (hCO-MPSs) to study AD monocyte-mediated neuroinflammation. By culturing doughnut-shape organoids on 3D-printed devices within standard 96-well plates, we generate hCO-MPSs with reduced necrosis, minimized hypoxia, and improved viability. Using these models, we found that monocytes from AD patients exhibit increased infiltration ability, decreased amyloid-Î² clearance capacity, and stronger inflammatory response than monocytes from age-matched control donors. Moreover, we observed that AD monocytes induce pro-inflammatory effects such as elevated astrocyte activation and neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, the marked increase in <i>IL1B</i> and <i>CCL3</i> expression underscores their pivotal role in AD monocyte-mediated neuroinflammation. Our findings provide insight into understanding monocytes' role in AD pathogenesis, and our lab-compatible MPS models may offer a promising way for studying various neuroinflammatory diseases.",
