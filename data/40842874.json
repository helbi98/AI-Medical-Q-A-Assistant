  "title": "Serological Status of Vaccine and Hepatitis B Virus Exposure Among Children Under 5 and Aged 15-17 Years in Kampala, Uganda.",
  "abstract": "Pediatric hepatitis B virus (HBV) serostatus remains variably characterized, hardly determined at times, or documented as part of national monitoring of the Extended Programs for Immunization (EPI).\nWe cross-sectionally characterized the seroprevalence of HBV vaccine and/or infection status among 501 and 288 children <5 and 15-17 years old, respectively, in Kawempe Division, Kampala, Uganda, between May and August 2023. These children received HBV vaccination under the Uganda National Extended Program on Immunizations (UNEPI). Samples were qualitatively screened for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb or anti-HBs), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb or anti-HBe), and for hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb or anti-HBc) using three different HBV Combo test rapid immunochromatographic diagnostic tests: Nova, Fastep, and Beright.\nThe seroprevalence of HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, anti-HBe, and anti-HBc was 1.52%, 27.75%, 0.88%, 0.63%, and 0.76%, respectively, for the combined study age groups. The HBsAg seroprevalence of 2.78% was almost 3.5-fold higher among adolescents when compared to the 0.8% observed in the under-5-year-olds. The qualitative seroprevalence of anti-HBs was 33.1% and 18.4% in the under-5 and among the 15-17-year-old study groups, respectively.\nThe proportion of qualitatively detectable anti-HBs in both groups of vaccinated children is low and probably indicates reduced seroprotection. Consequently, a large proportion of children who received the hepatitis B vaccine under UNEPI may be at risk of HBV infection, especially adolescents. A booster dose of the Hepatitis B Vaccine may be required for adolescents.",
