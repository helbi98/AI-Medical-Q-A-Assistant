  "title": "Physico-chemical characterization of fucoidans from three Sargassum species with assessment of antiviral, antioxidant, cytotoxicity and hypocholesterolemic actions: In vitro.",
  "abstract": "The sulfated polysaccharide cold and hot water extracts from Sargassum asperifolium, Sargassum dentifolium, and Sargassum linifolium, were purified. According to the physicochemical examination, the fucoidans of these species contain approximately 32-53 % sugars, 1.7-4.7 % sulfur, and 5-25 % ash. Fucose (9-31 %) and galactose (10-21 %) were present in the carbohydrate profiles. The protein concentration in the hot extracts varied between 6 % and 10 %. S. linifolium extracts potentially reduced the percentages of hepatitis C virus (HCV) (genotype 4a replicon) to 16.7 and 10 % using both cold and hot polysaccharides. Additionally, S. linifolium extracts showed 30 % and 60 % reduction in HCV at (0.5 and 455 μg/ml), respectively. They inhibited the adenovirus 40 titer by 60 % at (6.25 and 3.125 μg/ml). Furthermore, the examined cold Sargassum species extracts displayed cytotoxic potential against hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), with an LD<sub>50</sub> of 48.3 μg/ml for S. dentifolium cold polysaccharide, compared with doxorubicin (29.58 μg/ml). Moreover, the isolated polysaccharides captured DPPH and nitric oxide radicals in a concentration-dependent manner, ranging from 38 to 64 % and 42 to 79 %, respectively. S. asperifolium cold and hot fucoidans exhibited hypocholesterolemic effects of 89 % and 70 %, respectively, compared to fluvastatin. In conclusion, fucoidan has a promising role for hepatic ailments.",
