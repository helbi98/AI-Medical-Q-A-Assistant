  "title": "Fucoidan reduces the occurrence of Benzo(a)pyrene-induced lung cancer by alleviating the abnormal changes of club stem cells.",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to elucidate the anticancer mechanism of Fucoidan (FCD) in Benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P)-induced lung cancer, especially its effect on club stem cells. C57BL/6 wild-type mice received intratracheal instillations of B(a)P (1 mg/mouse) weekly for 4 consecutive weeks to establish an animal model of lung cancer. FCD interventions were administered ad libitum via drinking water. FCD can reduce the visible tumors occurrence on the surface of the lung at 34 weeks. Club stem cells initially exhibited a decrease in differentiation, followed by a compensatory increase, accompanied by accelerated proliferation and gene damage leading to mutation in the B(a)P-induced lung cancer model in mice. Importantly, single-cell trajectory analysis revealed that FCD promoted the differentiation of club cells into ciliated cells. Correspondingly, FCD promoted the expression of the ciliated cell marker Foxj1 gene in club cells at 26 weeks and 34 weeks. Additionally, FCD decreased the expression of the proliferation marker ki67, the gene damage protein γ-H2AX, and the number of mutated genes in club cells. In conclusion, Intervention with FCD may reduce the incidence of B(a)P-induced lung cancer by restraining the excessive proliferation of club cells, enhancing their differentiation, and mitigating gene damage and mutation.",
