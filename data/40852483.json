  "title": "Case Report: A rare case of ALK-KIF5B gene fusion benefited from treatment with lorlatinib.",
  "abstract": "The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (<i>ALK</i>) gene encodes a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase. Most mutations in <i>ALK</i> gene result from translocations with other genes, forming fusion oncogenes. To date, 21 different genes have been identified as <i>ALK</i> fusion partners, each activating distinct signaling pathways that influence cancer cell proliferation, invasiveness, and tumorigenicity. <i>ALK</i> tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK-TKIs) have demonstrated significant efficacy in <i>ALK</i>-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and are widely utilized as first-line therapy. Lorlatinib, a third-generation ALK inhibitor, is effective in both treatment-na√Øve and previously treated patients with advanced NSCLC, exhibiting strong systemic and intracranial antitumor activity. This report presented a case of lung adenocarcinoma with 51 genetic variants, including a rare fusion variant: exon 15 of <i>KIF5B</i> fused to exon 20 of <i>ALK</i>, KIF5B-ALK (K15:A20). Following lorlatinib treatment, partial remission was achieved, and disease stability was maintained for an extended period, suggesting a favorable response to therapy. This case highlighted the potential sensitivity of the <i>KIF5B-ALK</i> (K15:A20) fusion to lorlatinib and the need for further investigation into lorlatinib's efficacy across different <i>KIF5B-ALK</i> fusion variants. Additionally, other fusion types and treatment options for <i>KIF5B-ALK</i> fusions with varying breakpoints were discussed.",
