  "abstract": "Chronic respiratory diseases impart a huge global disease burden. Many cases of adult chronic respiratory disorders are recognised to originate early in life during critical phases of lung growth and development. We therefore reviewed the longitudinal evolution of common childhood respiratory diseases across the lifespan. We included studies relating childhood respiratory health (preterm birth, asthma, low lung function or bronchiectasis) to respiratory health in adolescents and adults, including COPD.The negative impact of preterm birth (with or without bronchopulmonary dysplasia) on future respiratory health has now been quantified, with many having increasing deviation of lung function from the norm over their life course. While previous studies report children with asthma frequently \"outgrow their disease\" by adolescence or early adulthood, recent data describe asthma trajectories that include relapse, early-onset adult-remitting, and early-onset persistent childhood asthma. Evidence is emerging in adults of the negative impact of chronic productive cough, breathlessness and lower lung function on future respiratory and cardiovascular health and all-cause mortality. In addition, we found that in general, childhood respiratory health and adverse lung function trajectories are inextricably linked to adult respiratory health and cardiovascular events, as well as cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Thus, we highlight the importance of pulmonary assessments in high-risk groups during childhood (<i>e.g.</i> preterm birth, parental smokers, early life hospitalisation for acute lower respiratory infections). Our review emphasises the importance of childhood respiratory health and the need for interventions to reduce or manage disease burden, which require a whole-of-society approach across the life course.",
