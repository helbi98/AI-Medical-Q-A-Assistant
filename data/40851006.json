  "abstract": "Legionella is the second cause of community-acquired pneumonia in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology and outcome in patients with Legionella pneumonia (LP) in French ICUs.\nA multi-center, retrospective, observational study in 12 French ICUs was performed between January 2014 and December 2019.\nLP was diagnosed in 162 patients during the study period. Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 95 patients (58%), 73 (45%) of whom had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Most of these patients were treated with a combination of antibiotics (128, patients; 79%). The most common combination consisted in a fluoroquinolone and a macrolide (118 patients). Median length of stay in an ICU was 11 [5; 11] days. At 28 days, 19 (12%) out of the 162 patients had not survived. In multivariate analyses, age (Incidence risk Ratio: IRR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01; 1.14) and a high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score in the first 48Â h (IRR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.09; 2) were significantly associated with mortality.\nIn this French multicentric cohort, the LP prognosis in ICUs was apparently more favorable than in the literature, possibly because of the timely and improved LP management in ICUs.",
