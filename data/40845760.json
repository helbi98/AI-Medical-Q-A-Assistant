  "abstract": "Forced vital capacity (FVC) continues to be the mainstay of risk stratification for the traumatic rib fractures (RFx) patient, and previous studies have shown its effective use of admitting patients to the appropriate level of care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of FVC as a criterion for transfer out of the intensive care unit (ICU).\nThis retrospective study included adult trauma patients with rib fractures admitted to the ICU at a level 1 trauma center from 2014 to 2021. Data was collected to include FVC, ICU and hospital length of stay, complications, and ICU readmissions. Patterns and thresholds of FVC improvement were investigated. This was determined identifying the difference between the third and first quartile of the average percentage change of the last 3 FVC measurements. P < 0.05 was considered significant.\nA total of 1215 patients were included for analysis. Median number of ICU days was 3. There were 85 (7%) ICU readmissions, 69 (5.7%) unplanned intubations, and 21 (2%) patients developed a pneumonia. Median ICU days increased with any of the aforementioned complications. Multiple patterns of FVC change and thresholds were investigated. There was no association between an FVC threshold of 1, or patterns of improvement, with clinical outcomes. This was likely limited to the low number of complications observed.\nThe utility of FVC measurement after ICU admission appears to be within the first 24 h. Trauma providers may still consider utilizing this measurement, as additional research is needed to determine the optimal frequency.",
