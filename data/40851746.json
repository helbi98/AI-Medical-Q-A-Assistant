  "title": "Information Needs and Fear of Radiotherapy in Women With Breast Cancer.",
  "abstract": "Radiotherapy constitutes a fundamental modality in breast cancer treatment; however, it is often accompanied by considerable patient fear, psychological distress, and unmet informational needs. Addressing these factors may enhance patient compliance and quality of care.\nA longitudinal cohort study was conducted at two radiotherapy departments in Thessaloniki, Greece, from October 2022 to May 2023. A total of 216 breast cancer patients were enrolled and assigned to a control group (n = 98), receiving standard care, or an intervention group (n = 118), receiving an informational brochure detailing radiotherapy procedures. Validated Greek versions of the Questionnaire for Assessing Fear of Radiotherapy in Oncology Patients (QAFRT), the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI), the Information Styles Questionnaire (ISQ), and the Profile of Mood States Short Form (POMS-S) were administered at baseline and upon completion of radiotherapy.\nAt baseline, groups were homogeneous in demographics and clinical characteristics, except for education level (P < 0.0005). Significant reductions in fear scores were observed in the intervention group across all QAFRT subscales (P < 0.0005), including fear of treatment effectiveness, illness during therapy, daily life disruption, and side effects. The intervention group also demonstrated significant improvements in psychological well-being, with reductions in tension, depression, anger, fatigue, and confusion, and increased vigor on the POMS-S (P < 0.0005). Symptom burden, as assessed by MDASI, improved significantly across all domains in the intervention group (P < 0.0005). Furthermore, informational needs regarding disease and treatment were significantly reduced in the intervention group post-intervention (P = 0.001), while psychological informational needs remained unchanged.\nProviding structured, written informational support prior to radiotherapy initiation significantly reduces fear, improves mood states, and alleviates symptom burden in breast cancer patients. These findings highlight the importance of tailored patient education in optimizing radiotherapy experiences and psychological outcomes.",
