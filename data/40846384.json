  "title": "Common Iliac Artery Stent Migration Post Intervention: A Case Report and Percutaneous Management Options.",
  "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease affects over 230 million people worldwide, presenting as intermittent claudication or critical limb ischemia. Endovascular revascularization, with self-expanding stents, has proven effective in treating iliac artery occlusions. However, rare complications like stent migration can occur. We report a rare case of common iliac artery stent migration across the aortic bifurcation.\nA 64-year-old man with diabetes and hypertension was evaluated for ischemic rest pain. He underwent iliac artery stenting and later developed worsening leg pain. Angiography revealed stent migration across the aortic bifurcation eventually managed percutaneously.\nStent migration while rare has been reported in the venous system, but reports of retrograde arterial stent migration are very rare. This case offers valuable insights into endovascular management of complex complications of iliac artery stenting while avoiding surgical intervention.\nRetrograde arterial stent migration, while rare, can be managed percutaneously. Adequate vessel preparation with intravascular imaging is crucial for prevention.",
