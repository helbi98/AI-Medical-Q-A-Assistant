  "abstract": "Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in both the mother and the fetus. These disorders often lead to significant systemic and ocular changes, particularly in the choroidal vasculature. The sub-foveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) may provide critical insights into these changes and serve as a non-invasive marker for assessing the severity of HDP.\nThe study aimed to compare the SFCT in patients with HDP versus normotensive pregnant women in their third trimester and to correlate SFCT with the severity of hypertension.\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted at JSS Hospital, Mysuru, involving 100 pregnant women in their third trimester, divided into 51 cases (HDP group) and 49 controls (normotensive group). SFCT was measured using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Data was analyzed and SFCT values compared between the two groups using mean arterial pressure (MAP).\nResults showed significantly higher SFCT in the HDP group (229.76 μm) compared to controls (173.45 μm), with a <i>p</i>-value < 0.001. The HDP group also had a notably higher MAP (115.07 mmHg vs. 87.63 mmHg), and a positive correlation (<i>r</i> = 0.541, <i>p</i> < 0.001) was found between MAP and SFCT.\nThe study demonstrates that SFCT is significantly increased in patients with HDP, correlating positively with MAP. Further studies are recommended to explore the broader clinical applications of SFCT in HDP.",
