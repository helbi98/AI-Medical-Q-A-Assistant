  "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has proven efficacy in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) and is the current standard of care for these patients. However, its cost-effectiveness in low- and middle-income settings has not been assessed before.\nThis study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of DBS compared with best medical therapy (BMT) in advanced PD from a societal perspective in Egypt.\nWe developed a Markov model with a 15-year time horizon and annual cycles to compare DBS with BMT. The cohort was aged 55-years-old at model entry and transitioned between three states: DBS, BMT, or death. Effectiveness was measured by improvement in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and reduction in drug doses. The main outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) mapped from the UPDRS scores. The model included medical, informal care, and indirect costs. Both costs and utilities were discounted at an annual rate of 3.5%.\nDBS had yielded an increase of 1.4 QALYs per patient at an additional cost of 1,159,150 Egyptian pounds (EGP)/patient ($25,566). This results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 830,726 EGP/QALY ($18,322/QALY). Patients with DBS have lower costs for medications, hospitalizations, informal care, and productivity loss. The main cost driver in the DBS arm is the device and implantation procedure costs, which accounted for 70% of total costs. The model was most sensitive to informal care costs.\nDBS markedly improves the quality of life for advanced patients with PD and reduces informal care and indirect costs. However, at its current price, the ICER exceeds the Egyptian cost-effectiveness threshold.",
