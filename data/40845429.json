  "abstract": "Poor adherence to prescribed anti-hypertensive treatments remains a significant public health challenge in Nigeria. This study assessed the barriers and enablers of anti-hypertensive medication adherence among hypertensives seeking care in public secondary health facilities in Delta State, Nigeria.\nA mixed quantitative and qualitative method was employed to assess the barriers and enablers of anti-hypertensive medication adherence among a random multistage sample of 451 adult hypertensives. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered semi-structured questionnaire and a focus group discussion guide. Descriptive and inferential analyses of the data collected were carried out using the IBM SPSS version 26 software.\nThe mean age of the study participants was 53.5 (SD = 9.9) years, with 80.7% (n = 364) reporting poor anti-hypertensive medication adherence. Those with good adherence were likely to be at least 50 years old (AOR = 2.625; 95% CI: 1.353 - 4.485; P = 0.014), have tertiary education (AOR = 7.797; 95% CI: 3.359 - 9.758; P = 0.009), belong to the upper socio-economic class (AOR = 2.546; 95% CI: 1.968 - 4.761; P < 0.001) and living with hypertension for at least five years (AOR=1.752; 95% CI: 1.367 - 7.456; P = 0.003).\nAnti-hypertensive medication adherence was generally poor among the study participants. There is a need for concerted efforts by health providers to regularly screen for anti-hypertensive adherence and provide qualitative health education targeted at improving adherence to medication among hypertensives.",
