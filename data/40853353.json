  "title": "Cost-effectiveness of insulin icodec for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Canada.",
  "abstract": "AimPatients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with poor glycemic control despite use of non-insulin agents can experience delay in initiating insulin therapy and poor adherence to insulin therapy, predominantly due to the burden of multiple injections(1-3). This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of insulin icodec, first once-weekly basal insulin, compared with long-acting basal insulins for improving glycemic control in adults with T2D in Canada.Materials and MethodsThe Swedish Institute of Health Economics T2D Cohort Model was used to analyse three T2D groups: insulin na√Øve (IN), basal insulin experienced (BIE), and basal-bolus insulin experienced (BBIE). Comparators included insulin glargine, insulin detemir, and insulin degludec. Comparative efficacy was informed by the phase 3 ONWARDS trials of insulin icodec and network meta-analyses (NMA). Time horizon was 40 years. Analyses considered disutilities resulting from vascular complications, age, gender, diabetes duration, hypoglycemia, and injection burden. A 1.5% annual discount rate was used for costs and effects. The average cost per unit for each treatment, accounting for the market share of available formats and biosimilars was calculated. Outcomes were expressed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness as incremental cost utility ratios (ICUR [cost/QALY]).ResultsIn all analyses, insulin icodec dominated insulin degludec and insulin detemir. Compared to insulin glargine U100 and U300, insulin icodec was associated with ICURs of $17,876, $20,844, and $73,253; and $6,439, $8,623, and $45,433 in the IN, BIE, and BBIE populations, respectively.LimitationsLimitations of this economic evaluation include the lack of data for some treatments in certain NMAs, uncertainty regarding the use of the NMA results for a 40-year time horizon, heterogeneous sources of disutilities, and uncertainty regarding the HRQoL benefits of reduced injection frequency.ConclusionsInsulin icodec is a cost-effective treatment option for adult patients with T2D versus once daily basal insulin-analogues publicly reimbursed in Canada.",
