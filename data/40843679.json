  "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Podocalyxin (PODXL) has been identified as a promising therapeutic target and a potential diagnostic biomarker in various tumors. Despite the therapeutic potential of anti-PODXL monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), their further development has been limited by concerns regarding potential on-target off-tumor toxicities. To minimize adverse effects on normal tissues, developing a cancer-specific mAb (CasMab) against PODXL is essential. <b>Methods</b>: Our group established a cancer-specific anti-PODXL mAb, PcMab-60 (IgM, Îº), through the screening of over one hundred hybridoma clones. In this study, PcMab-60 was engineered into a humanized IgG<sub>1</sub>-type mAb (humPcMab-60), and its antitumor activity was examined using mouse xenograft models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and colorectal cancer. <b>Results</b>: HumPcMab-60 retains cancer-specific reactivity; humPcMab-60 reacted to PDAC cell lines (PK-45H and MIA PaCa-2) and the colorectal cancer cell line (Caco-2), but not to a normal lymphatic endothelial cell line in flow cytometry. Furthermore, humPcMab-60 exerted antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity against PODXL-expressing cell lines and showed antitumor effects against the tumor xenografts. <b>Conclusions</b>: A humanized anti-PODXL CasMab, humPcMab-60, could be a promising mAb-based tumor therapy.",
