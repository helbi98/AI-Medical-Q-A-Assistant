  "abstract": "This study aims to compare risk factors and mortality of candidemia by <i>Candida auris</i> versus <i>Candida</i> non<i>-auris</i> in intensive care units (ICU).\nA total of 437 ICU patients who developed candidemia (90 <i>C. auris</i>, 143 <i>C. albicans</i>, 204 other <i>Candida</i> spp.) in 2021-2023 were included. The risk factors in candidemia caused by <i>C. auris</i>, <i>C. albicans</i> and other <i>Candida</i> spp. were compared. Factors associated with 30-day mortality in <i>C. auris</i> candidemia were explored.\nCompared to the <i>C. albicans</i> group, the <i>C. auris</i> group had more frequent ceftazidime avibactam use (OR:6.72, 95%CI: 1.29-34.98, <i>p</i> = 0.024) and tracheostomy (OR:4.13, 95%CI: 1.70-10.02, <i>p</i> = 0.002), longer colistin (OR:1.07, 95%CI: 1.01-1.13, <i>p</i> = 0.021) and urinary catheter use (OR:1.02, 95%CI: 1.01-1.03, <i>p</i> = 0.023). Compared to the other <i>Candida</i> spp. group, colistin use (OR:2.79, 95%CI: 1.61-4.87, <i>p</i> < 0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR:2.02, 95%CI: 1.05-3.90, <i>p</i> = 0.036) and concurrent bacteraemia (OR:1.92, 95%CI: 1.06-3.48, <i>p</i> = 0.030) were more frequent in the <i>C. auris</i> group. Rate of 30-day mortality was lower in <i>C. auris</i> patients (63.3%) compared to the <i>C. albicans</i> (82.5%) and other <i>Candida</i> spp. (75.5%) groups. While the 30-day mortality rate was higher in <i>C. auris</i> patients who received vasopressor therapy (OR:3.12, 95%CI: 1.78-5.47, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and had high lactate levels (OR:1.41, 95%CI: 1.00-1.99, <i>p</i> = 0.047) and low platelet counts (OR:1.00, 95%CI: 0.99-1.00, <i>p</i> = 0.003) on the first day of candidemia, it was lower in patients with microbiologic response (OR:0.03, 95%CI: 0.01-0.09, <i>p</i> < 0.001).\nThe necessity of broad-spectrum antibiotics and indwelling catheters should be routinely reassessed to reduce <i>C. auris</i> candidemia. Lower mortality was linked to microbiologic response; thus, fungal eradication should be prioritised in clinical practice.",
