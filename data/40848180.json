  "title": "Clinical value of serum miR-451 in early diagnosis of multiple system atrophy from parkinson's disease and outcomes prediction.",
  "abstract": "The clinical diagnosis of multiple system atrophy (MSA) mainly depends on imaging examinations, and the misdiagnosis rate is high due to its similar symptoms to Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThis study aimed to identify a non-invasive indicator assisting in discriminating MSA and PD and predict the development of MSA.\nThis study enrolled 127 PD patients, 62 MSA patients, and 78 healthy individuals and collected their serum samples. The serum miR-451 levels were analyzed by PCR. The severity of MSA patients was assessed by the Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale-II (UMSARS-II). The outcomes of MSA patients were evaluated from the perspectives of cognitive function and motor symptoms.\nSignificant upregulation of miR-451 was observed in PD and MSA patients, and MSA patients showed higher serum miR-451 levels. Increasing serum miR-451 levels diagnosed PD and MSA patients from healthy individuals and could discriminate MSA patients from PD patients. miR-451 was positively correlated with UMSARS-II and SCOPA-AUT scores and showed a negative correlation with the MMSE score. MSA patients with motor symptoms and cognitive dysfunction showed higher serum miR-451 levels, and miR-451 was identified as a risk factor predicting the occurrence of cognitive dysfunction and motor symptoms.\nSerum miR-451 can serve as a biomarker for screening MSA and predicting disease development.",
