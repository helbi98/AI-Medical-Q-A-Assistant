  "title": "Neuropsychiatric symptom trajectories across cognitive spectrums of Alzheimer's disease: Joint probabilities with cognitive and functional decline.",
  "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs), cognitive and functional decline developed heterogeneously in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to compare distinct NPS burden trajectories across cognitive spectrums, and their joint probabilities with cognition and function.\nData were from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. Group-Based Trajectory Model was utilized to identify NPSs trajectories across cognitive impaired (CI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. Dual-trajectory models were used to evaluate joint probabilities of NPSs, cognition and function. Linear mixed-effect models were used to assess their impact on NPSs.\nThree distinct NPS trajectories-almost asymptomatic-stable, moderate slow-rising, and severe persistent aggravated were identified, with variations in NPS severity and progression across CI, MCI and AD. Sex, age, APOEε4 alleles, and obesity influenced trajectory severity, with males and APOEε4 carriers showing faster deterioration. Individuals with rapid cognitive decline exhibited higher probabilities of moderate slow-rising (55.73 % in CI; 52.22 % in MCI; 29.26 % in AD), and a small proportion to severe persistent aggravated NPSs (25.51 % in CI; 4.53 % in MCI; 14.50 % in AD). Subjects with moderate functional decline showed moderate slow-rising NPSs (50.33 % in CI; 48.73 % in MCI; 33.44 % in AD), and high functional decline trajectory experience moderate slow-rising NPSs (54.97 % in CI; 71.29 % in MCI; 48.49 % in AD).\nMCI and AD patients exhibit severer NPSs and faster progression. Rapid cognitive impairment and severe functional decline are more likely to develop severe and persistent NPSs. This study underscores the necessity to manage these interconnected symptoms in AD courses, especially in the MCI stage.",
