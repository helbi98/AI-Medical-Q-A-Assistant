  "abstract": "To assess the function of the erector spinae muscle's cross-sectional area (ESM<sub>CSA</sub>)as a biomarker for the outcome of AECOPD hospitalized patients. Based on chest CT imaging, ESM<sub>CSA</sub> were caculated following admission. Cox regression analyses, including univariate and multivariate approaches, were utilized to determine risk factors associated with 1-year mortality and initial hospitalization in patients with AECOPD. Additionally, Poisson regression was implemented to assess the rate of rehospitalization. There were 236 AECOPD patient included in the present study, including 59 and 177 patients in the ESM<sub>CSA</sub> lower group and normal groups respectively. Seventeen patients died within 1 year after discharged from the hospital, and the 1-year mortality rates were 15.3% and 4.5% for the ESM<sub>CSA</sub> lower group and normal group. A total of 112 patients suffered from 273 rehospitalizations for AECOPD within 1 year after discharged from hospital. Cox regression analysis showed that ESM<sub>CSA</sub> were associated with the 1-year first hospitalization for AECOPD. Poisson regression analysis showed that ESM<sub>CSA</sub> were associated with the rate of rehospitalization for AECOPD (IRR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.45-0.73 for univariate analysis, and IRR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.43-0.72for multivariate analysis). Both univariate (HR = 0.29 95% CI: 0.11-0.75) and multivariate Cox regression analyses (HR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.12-0.99) showed that ESM<sub>CSA</sub> was associated with 1-year mortality. Lower ESM<sub>CSA</sub> was a risk factor of 1-year mortality and 1-year rehospitalization for AECOPD.",
