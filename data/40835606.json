  "title": "Tumor cell-adipocyte gap junctions activate lipolysis and contribute to breast tumorigenesis.",
  "abstract": "A pro-tumorigenic role for adipocytes has been identified in breast cancer, and reliance on fatty acid catabolism found in aggressive tumors. The molecular mechanisms by which tumor cells coopt neighboring adipocytes, however, remain incompletely understood. Here, we describe a direct interaction linking tumorigenesis to adjacent adipocytes. We examine breast tumors and their normal adjacent tissue from several patient cohorts, patient-derived xenografts, and mouse models, and find that lipolysis and lipolytic signaling are activated in neighboring adipose tissue. We find that functional gap junctions form between breast cancer cells and adipocytes. As a result, cAMP is transferred from breast cancer cells to adipocytes and activates lipolysis in a gap junction-dependent manner. We find that connexin 31 (GJB3) promotes receptor triple negative breast cancer growth and activation of lipolysis in vivo. Thus, direct tumor cell-adipocyte interaction contributes to tumorigenesis and may serve as a new therapeutic target in breast cancer.",
