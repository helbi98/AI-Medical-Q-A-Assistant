  "title": "Secondary stroke evaluation in patients admitted for CRAO in a large national inpatient sample.",
  "abstract": "Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is an ophthalmic condition associated with cerebrovascular ischaemia. In patients with acute CRAO, the 2021 American Heart Association (AHA) scientific statement recommends a diagnostic evaluation for secondary stroke prevention, including cerebrovascular imaging, cardiac rhythm monitoring, echocardiogram and labs. This study aims to understand the national stroke evaluation rates for patients with CRAO before 2021.\nRetrospective, cross-sectional analysis of inpatient admissions from the National Inpatient Sample between 2016 and 2021. Echocardiogram, head and neck vessel imaging and temporal artery biopsy completion during hospital admissions with a principal diagnosis of CRAO were measured. Clustering analysis was performed to characterise differences in stroke evaluations.\n9615 inpatient stays for CRAO were identified. Only 0.3% underwent carotid ultrasounds, 10% underwent echocardiograms, and 8.5% underwent cerebrovascular imaging. Echocardiograms (10%) were most frequently performed, followed by temporal artery biopsy (6.4%). Clustering analysis reveals a cluster of older females on non-Health Maintenance Organisation Medicare receiving temporal artery biopsies. Other clusters consisted of younger males, who were more likely to receive an echocardiogram or cerebrovascular imaging and be discharged home. Independent predictors increasing the odds of undergoing stroke evaluations include female sex, transfer from another facility, residence in zip codes with a median household income of >$79 000, concurrent diagnosis of cerebral stroke, carotid atherosclerosis and nicotine dependence through cigarette use.\nIn this national cohort study, low percentages of patients with CRAO were evaluated for secondary stroke prevention before the 2021 AHA scientific statement on CRAO management. Notably, higher socioeconomic status patients underwent more comprehensive stroke evaluations.",
