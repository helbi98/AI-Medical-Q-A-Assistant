  "title": "Spatial regulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells at the HLA-E-NKG2A axis drives HIV persistence in lymph node B cell follicles.",
  "abstract": "B cell follicles (BCFs) in the lymph node are a major sanctuary for HIV reservoirs. Immune regulatory mechanisms hindering cytolytic CD8<sup>+</sup> responses at these sites are poorly characterized, likely enabling HIV persistence. Spatial transcriptomics and high-dimensional histocytometry were used to define CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell function and immune regulation in lymph node (LN) follicles of people living with HIV (PLWH), at various stages of antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment. Histocytometry demonstrated that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells infiltrating BCFs mostly lacked granzyme B expression, coinciding with reduced chromatin access at cytolytic gene loci in dissociated lymph node cells. Spatial transcriptomics confirmed the immune regulatory microenvironment of HIV-infected BCFs, particularly exhibiting upregulation of HLA-E. Additional fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis identified a subset of LN CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing the NKG2A-interacting partner of HLA-E, with reduced granzyme B expression. These findings suggest that regulation of follicular CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells at the HLA-E-NKG2A axis may be a key mechanism for HIV immune evasion.",
