  "title": "Advances in fibroblast-based cardiac reprogramming in the treatment of heart disease.",
  "abstract": "Due to population aging and a wide range of risk factors, coupled with the limited regenerative capacity of the myocardium, the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases remain challenging.\nThis review evaluates cardiac reprogramming as an innovative approach to directly convert fibroblasts into functional cardiomyocytes through genetic or pharmacological means. We focus on its application in myocardial infarction, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and heart failure, and discuss strategies for improving reprogramming efficiency and recent advances in nanomaterial-assisted delivery.\nCardiac reprogramming shows potential in reducing fibrosis and restoring function, with efficiency improved through novel delivery systems and optimized protocols.\nThis technology represents a promising strategy for cardiac regeneration, future work should focus on optimizing reprogramming protocols and developing clinically viable delivery systems to accelerate therapeutic translation.",
