  "abstract": "A 30-year-old male patient who reported a medical history of bronchial asthma and diabetes mellitus presented with bilateral leg pain and weakness during exercise. He experienced leg numbness for the previous six months. Imaging detected a thromboembolic occlusion in the abdominal aorta, along with a left atrial mass. He underwent an emergency embolectomy with a Fogarty balloon catheter;however, persistent embolism at the aortic bifurcation required surgical embolus removal. The embolus consisted of both fresh thrombus and mucous-like tumor tissue, which was determined as a myxoma. Further left atrial mass assessment indicated a myxoma. After successful revascularization and left atrial mass removal, the patient recovered without complications, and he was discharged home 24 days after rehabilitation.",
