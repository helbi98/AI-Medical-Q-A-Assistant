  "title": "Resistant hypertension treated with laparoscopic-assisted renal denervation in a patient with end-stage renal disease: a case report.",
  "abstract": "In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis, hypertension is commonly detected and inadequately controlled despite the use of multiple anti-hypertensive medications. Sympathetic hyperactivation is a key feature in chronic kidney disease and can be targeted by renal denervation (RDN).\nA 47-year-old male patient with pharmacologically resistant hypertension and ESRD on peritoneal dialysis underwent radiofrequency renal nerve ablation using a laparoscopic-assisted system. During the 6-month follow-up after the operation, we observed a remarkable and sustained reduction in blood pressure, with a significant decrease in oral anti-hypertensive medications.\nThis case demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of laparoscopic-assisted RDN for lowering blood pressure. This technology, as an alternative to catheter-based RDN, bears the potential for wider application in high-risk patients with severe renal failure.",
