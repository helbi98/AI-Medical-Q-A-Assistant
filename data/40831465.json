  "title": "Impact of metabolic dysfunction on treatment responses to nucleos(t)ide analogues in chronic hepatitis B: a retrospective multi-center REAL-B cohort study.",
  "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction is associated with liver disease but it is unclear if it would impact responses to antiviral treatment in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients.\nUsing data from an international consortium of 4507 treatment-naïve CHB patients who initiated nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) between January 2004 and August 2024 from 32 centers and propensity-score matching (PSM) to balance the background of patients with and without metabolic disease (diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, or hypertension), we compared their biochemical (BR), virologic (VR), and complete (CR) response.\nMore than half (54.8%) had at least one metabolic disease. Patients with metabolic disease (vs. no) were older and more likely male. In the PSM cohort of 893 pairs of patients, patients with metabolic disease had significantly lower 5-year cumulative BR (91.3% vs. 95.8%, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and CR rates (81.8% vs. 87.4%, <i>P</i> = 0.008), but similar VR (93.5% vs. 94.1%, <i>P</i> = 0.65) and HBeAg seroconversion rates (27.0% vs. 29.7%, <i>P</i> = 0.92). On multivariable Cox regression, metabolic disease was associated with lower BR (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.73, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and CR (aHR 0.79, <i>P</i> = 0.001), especially in those with ≥3 metabolic diseases (aHR 0.55 for BR; aHR 0.53 for CR, both <i>P</i> < 0.001).\nThe presence and number of metabolic diseases were significantly and incrementally associated with lower BR. Metabolic disease should be taken into consideration in the management of CHB patients receiving NAs treatment.\nNone.",
