  "abstract": "The rapid and accurate identification of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MTB) is essential for effective tuberculosis (TB) control. However, conventional diagnostic methods for MTB suffer from limitations such as low sensitivity, poor specificity, high cost, reliance on specialized instruments, and complex, time-consuming procedures. To address these challenges, there is an urgent need for a simple, rapid, and highly sensitive detection method that can be deployed in point-of-care settings.\nWe developed a one-pot biosensing system combining recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and CRISPR/Cas12a-driven G4-hemin self-assembly for the colorimetric detection of MTB. Glycerol was employed as a phase-separation barrier to prevent interference between RPA amplification and CRISPR/Cas12a trans-cleavage. A single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probe, designed to self-assemble with ssDNA-hemin into G4-hemin nanozymes upon CRISPR/Cas12a-mediated cleavage, served as the reaction substrate. The ssDNA-hemin further enhanced the catalytic activity of the generated G4-hemin DNAzyme. The entire assay was completed in a single step within 60 min without requiring complex instrumentation.\nUnder optimized conditions, the biosensing system achieved ultrasensitive naked-eye detection of MTB with a limit of detection (LOD) of 10 copies/μL, comparable to traditional four-step fluorescent assays. Clinical validation using 104 patient samples demonstrated high concordance with standard diagnostic methods. This approach combines the advantages of recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), CRISPR/Cas12a specificity, and G4-hemin DNAzyme-based colorimetric signal amplification, enabling simple, equipment-free visual detection. Given its speed, sensitivity, and ease of use, this biosensing system holds significant promise for point-of-care MTB nucleic acid testing in resource-limited settings.",
