  "title": "Race- and ethnicity-specific patient-provider relationship characteristics associated with antiretroviral therapy adherence and viral suppression among minority women with HIV, Miami-Dade County, Florida, 2021-2022.",
  "abstract": "We conducted a cross-sectional study to examine the associations between items of the patient-provider relationship measures and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and viral suppression within each of three ethnic groups of women with HIV (WHIV) - Hispanic, Haitian, and African American - using data from 542 WHIV enrolled in the Miami-Dade County Ryan White Program. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were applied for each patient-provider relationship variable, stratified by race/ethnicity. Overall, 71.9% of participants were adherent to ART, and 91.2% had suppressed viral loads. Among Haitian women, patient involvement in HIV care decision-making was associated with increased adherence to ART. For African American women, ART adherence was positively associated with providers spending adequate time with patients, showing respect, listening carefully, and considering their need for privacy. Among Hispanic women, ART adherence was positively associated with providers asking about difficulties in managing health, spending adequate time, listening carefully, and involving patients in decision-making. Additionally, providers spending enough time with the patient and expressing interest in the patient as a person were strongly associated with viral suppression among Hispanics. Findings highlight the critical role of culturally sensitive, patient-centered care in promoting ART adherence and viral suppression among racial and ethnic minority WHIV.",
