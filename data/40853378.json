  "title": "Lymphoma and Long-Term cardiovascular disease risk: A comprehensive analysis from the UK biobank.",
  "abstract": "Lymphoma survivors may face an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), but large-scale studies comprehensively assessing this risk are limited. This study aims to investigate the association between lymphoma and incident CVDs, and to explore differences across lymphoma subtypes and potential effect modifiers. This retrospective cohort study used UK Biobank data. 3,244 lymphoma patients were matched 1:5 to 16,208 non-cancer controls based on demographics, lifestyle, and health factors. Incident CVDs were ascertained from electronic health records. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association between lymphoma and each cardiovascular outcome, adjusting for key demographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors. After multivariable adjustment, lymphoma was significantly associated with increased risks of myocarditis/pericarditis (HR: 3.24, 95% CI: 2.26-4.63), heart failure/cardiomyopathy (HR: 2.65, 95% CI: 2.26-3.11), atrial fibrillation/flutter (HR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.58-2.04), valve diseases (HR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.47-2.19), conduction system disease (HR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.37-1.98), supraventricular arrhythmias (HR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.07-2.17), peripheral arterial disease (HR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.18-1.84), and ischemic heart disease (HR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.04-1.34). Risk varied significantly across lymphoma subtypes, with Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and peripheral/cutaneous T-cell lymphomas exhibiting particularly elevated risks for several outcomes. Subgroup analyses indicated that age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and hypertension status significantly modified some associations. Lymphoma is associated with a significantly increased risk of multiple CVDs. Findings highlight the need for cardiovascular risk assessment and tailored management in lymphoma survivors, considering subtype and individual risk factors.",
