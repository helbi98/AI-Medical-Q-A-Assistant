  "title": "Novel role of splicing factor U2AF2 in the tumour microenvironment and its clinical prognostic value: a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis and experimental validation with a focus on COAD.",
  "abstract": "U2AF2 (U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor 2), a crucial spliceosome component regulating RNA splicing, plays a dual role in T-cell function and tumorigenesis. This study integrated multi-omics analysis with experimental validation to elucidate the oncogenic mechanisms of U2AF2 in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD).\nU2AF2 expression and its clinical significance were analysed using publicly available COAD transcriptomic and clinical datasets. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of COAD tissues and multiplex immunofluorescence were used to assess the association between U2AF2 expression and tumour immune microenvironment composition. The in vitro functional consequences of U2AF2 knockdown on proliferation, migration, and apoptosis were evaluated in COAD cell lines (HCT116, HCT8) using specific assays.\nThe results revealed that splicing factors play a key role in viral infection and regulating of T cell function in the CD4<sup>+</sup> cell subsets. U2AF2 mRNA and protein expression were significantly upregulated in COAD patients and were strongly associated with poor prognosis. U2AF2 also exhibited high diagnostic efficiency in COAD and predicted poor overall and disease-free survival. Our study also revealed that high U2AF2 expression was significantly correlated with decreased infiltration levels in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Furthermore, U2AF2 knockdown significantly inhibited COAD cell proliferation and migration, while promoting apoptosis.\nWe demonstrate U2AF2's dual oncogenic mechanisms, driving malignant transformation through aberrant RNA splicing and fostering immunosuppression by reshaping the tumour immune landscape. These findings establish U2AF2 as a promising novel therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker for COAD.",
