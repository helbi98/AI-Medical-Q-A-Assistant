  "title": "Percutaneous Peripheral Nerve Stimulation in Chemotherapy-Induced Neuropathy: A Case Report.",
  "abstract": "<b>Background and Clinical Significance</b>: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a frequent and limiting complication of oncological treatment, particularly in patients receiving oxaliplatin. Its onset can significantly affect the quality of life and compromise the continuity of the antineoplastic therapy. Due to the limited efficacy of available pharmacological therapies, percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PENS) has been proposed as a non-invasive alternative for symptom management. <b>Case presentation</b>: We report the case of a 75-year-old woman with colorectal adenocarcinoma who developed CIPN following oxaliplatin administration. She underwent a 12-week course of PENS targeting the median nerve, with weekly sessions conducted without interruption of chemotherapy and without adverse effects. The patient showed progressive improvement in neurosensory symptoms, as measured by the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 questionnaire. Quantitative sensory testing revealed normalization of thermal and vibratory sensitivity and improved mechanical detection thresholds. The cumulative oxaliplatin dose was maintained throughout treatment. <b>Conclusions</b>: PENS may offer an effective and safe therapeutic option for managing CIPN, enabling symptom control without compromising oncological treatment. This case supports the need for controlled clinical trials to confirm efficacy and establish standardized protocols.",
