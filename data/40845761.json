  "title": "The Age-Male-Albumin-Bilirubin-Platelet Risk Score Predicts Postoperative Prognosis of Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma: A Multicenter Retrospective Study.",
  "abstract": "The age-male-albumin-bilirubin-platelets (AMAP) score serves as a specific model for assessing liver fibrosis among individuals with chronic hepatitis B. However, there remains ambiguity regarding its ability to reliably predict the long-term outcomes for patients diagnosed with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) after undergoing radical surgical interventions.\nThis retrospective multicenter investigation included 681 participants diagnosed with ICC who had undergone radical surgical procedures. The AMAP risk score was computed according to the following equation: (0.06 × age + 0.48 × ALBI - 0.01 × platelet + 7.4)/14.77 × 100. To assess the clinical significance of the AMAP score on survival outcomes, Kaplan-Meier methods, log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazards regression models were utilized. In addition, a nomogram was created utilizing the outcomes of the multivariate analysis.\nThe AMAP model demonstrated a significant correlation with the rates of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in individuals diagnosed with ICC. Patients in the low-risk group exhibited significantly longer DFS (P = 0.002) and OS (P < 0.001) compared to those in the high-risk group. In addition, a nomogram was constructed to predict DFS, achieving a C-index of 0.705, and for OS, a C-index of 0.753. The nomogram based on AMAP demonstrates strong predictive performance.\nThe AMAP score functions as a prospective prognostic indicator for individuals diagnosed with ICC. A nomogram incorporates the AMAP score proves valuable in recognizing patients with ICC who are at high risk and supports the creation of adjuvant treatment plans.",
