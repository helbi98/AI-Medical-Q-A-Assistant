  "title": "Targeted ROS Scavenging for Disease Therapies Using Nanomaterials.",
  "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential by-products of cellular metabolism and serve as key mediators in cell signaling and homeostasis. Excessive ROS production is associated with cellular damage and various diseases. Therefore, targeted ROS scavenging may enhance therapeutic efficacy and minimize side effects. With significant progress in nanotechnology, various nanomaterials with targeted ROS-scavenging properties have been developed to modulate ROS levels in biological microenvironments. In this review, the mechanisms underlying ROS generation and elimination in humans and in ROS-related diseases are first outlined. The latest advancements in ROS-scavenging nanomaterials, particularly their mechanisms and composition-based classifications, are then focused on. Strategies for improving the targeting ability of ROS-scavenging nanomaterials and their application in the therapeutics of ROS-induced diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, acute kidney injury, diabetic wounds, and cancer are highlighted. Finally, the challenges faced by ROS-targeted nanotherapeutics are discussed, and possible alternatives to accelerate their clinical translation are proposed.",
