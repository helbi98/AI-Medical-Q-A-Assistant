  "title": "Impact of Aortic Atherosclerosis on Clinical Outcomes After Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.",
  "abstract": "Aortic atherothrombotic lesions can cause systemic embolization and adverse outcomes after interventional procedures.\nThis study aimed to assess the association between the degree of aortic atherosclerosis and clinical outcomes after transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).\nThis single-center observational study included data from 278 patients who underwent transfemoral TAVR. The degree of aortic atherosclerosis in the ascending aorta, aortic arch, descending aorta, and abdominal aorta according to preoperative enhanced computed tomography was evaluated, and extensive intimal thickening ≥ 4 mm or mobile-looking, ulcerated or protruding atheroma were considered to be atherothrombotic lesions. Patients were classified into two groups: those with and without atherothrombotic lesions. Clinical outcomes, including all-cause death, stroke, systemic embolization, and worsening renal function, were investigated.\nOf 278 patients, 116 (41.4%) exhibited atherothrombotic lesions. Baseline renal function was significantly worse in patients with atherothrombotic lesions. There were no significant differences in the occurrence of all-cause death (0% vs. 0.6%; p > 0.99), stroke (3.5% vs. 2.5%; p = 0.72), systemic embolism (0.9% vs. 0%; p = 0.42), and worsening renal function (increase in serum creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL or ≥ 1.5-fold from baseline; 5.4% vs. 5.2%; p = 0.93) within 1-month. During a median follow-up of 3.0 years (interquartile range 2.0-4.0 years), the occurrence of all-cause death was numerically higher in patients with atherothrombotic lesions compared to those without.\nAtherothrombotic lesions were commonly observed in patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR. No significant clinical effect of aortic atherosclerosis on short-term adverse outcomes was observed, although long-term mortality was numerically higher in patients who exhibited atherothrombotic lesions.",
