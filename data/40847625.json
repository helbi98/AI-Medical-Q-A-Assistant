  "title": "Help-Seeking Behaviours for Mental Health in East Asian American Informal Caregivers of People Living With Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias.",
  "abstract": "To explore mental health help-seeking behaviours among East Asian American dementia caregivers and construct a theory grounded in their behaviour patterns.\nQualitative using constructivist grounded theory design.\nWe recruited 20 East Asian American dementia caregivers between August 2023 and March 2024 using purposive sampling. We conducted one-on-one interviews and analysed the data using constructivist grounded theory coding.\nWe constructed a theory including six concepts and 22 categories. While 'providing care', caregivers manage caregiving tasks and personal life, experiencing caregiving challenges. 'Individual capacity' is a key to perceiving caregiving situations and 'considering seeking support'. Various factors can affect 'using support'. Different types of support can be used separately or in combination. When receiving adequate support, caregivers can 'gain benefits from support'. These benefits, alongside individual capacities, can shape caregivers' 'outlook on the present and the future'.\nThis study explains the mental health help-seeking process within East Asian culture, broadening perspectives on diverse populations and highlighting insights into culturally tailored services.\nThis study offers clinicians and communities insights into the mental health help-seeking process among East Asian American dementia caregivers and highlights strategies to encourage their use of mental health services.\nThis theory incorporates aspects of East Asian culture, addressing a research gap in studies of Asian Americans. It may enhance understanding of culturally tailored approaches and facilitate future funding for research and services, considering cultural diversity.\nThe Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research.\nNo Patient or Public Contribution.",
