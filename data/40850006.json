  "title": "Characterization of lytic bacteriophage vB_EhoP_ZX13 and its therapeutic potential against Enterobacter hormaechei infection.",
  "abstract": "Enterobacter hormaechei (E. hormaechei) is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause various animal diseases under certain conditions, including pneumonia, peritonitis, and pyogenic endometritis. The emergence of multidrug-resistant E. hormaechei has severely limited treatment options, highlighting the urgent need for alternative therapeutic strategies such as bacteriophage therapy. In this study, we isolated and characterized a lytic bacteriophage, vB_EhoP_ZX13, from aquaculture samples using E. hormaechei-Eho13 as the host. Morphological analysis revealed that vB_EhoP_ZX13 exhibited typical long-tailed phage characteristics and belonged to the family Straboviridae. It demonstrated the optimal infection efficiency at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, with a short latent period (5 min) and a high burst size (100 PFU/cell). Furthermore, the phage remained stable at 4-30 °C and pH 5-8, but was sensitive to high temperatures and ultraviolet (UV) light exposure. Genomic analysis revealed a 172,900 bp double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome encoding 295 open reading frames (ORFs) and 19 tRNAs. Crucially, no genes associated with virulence factors, lysogenic genes, or antibiotic resistance-related were identified, supporting its biosafety for therapeutic. In vitro, vB_EhoP_ZX13 significantly inhibited the growth of Eho13. In vivo, phage treatment markedly improved the survival rate of infected mice, with a 90 % survival observed when administered at an MOI of 1. In summary, vB_EhoP_ZX13 is a lytic phage with strong antibacterial activity both in vitro and in vivo, highlighting its promise as an alternative therapeutic agent against E. hormaechei infections.",
