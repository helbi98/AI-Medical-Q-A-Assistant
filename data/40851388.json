  "title": "SOTA: A statistical tool for quantifying the superiority onset time of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor response based on Kaplan-Meier graphics and its application in a meta-analysis of NSCLC randomized controlled trials.",
  "abstract": "PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors exert a unique delayed effect in clinical practice, although the exact duration of this delay remains inconclusive. To address this, we developed an algorithm-SOTA (Superiority Onset-Time Algorithm) to quantify the delayed effect and estimate the post-onset therapeutic benefit and applied it based on a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to calculate the delayed effect of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nSOTA reconstructs Kaplan-Meier curves from published figures, recovers individual-level data, and applies a piecewise Cox model to identify the optimal breakpoint as superiority onset time (SOT). It also enables the estimation of post-onset efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors by using landmark analysis to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) after the SOT. The code is available at: https://github.com/qihanfan/SOTA. Then we applied SOTA in a meta-analysis of phase II/III RCTs in NSCLC, identified through a systematic search up to Mar 9, 2025. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted in accordance with Cochrane guidelines. Pooled estimates of SOT and post-onset HR were obtained.\nSimulation studies confirmed the accuracy of the SOTA. For survival data reconstruction, the average value of mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and maximum deviation between the raw and reconstructed data were 0.008, 0.011, and 0.050, respectively. For the estimation of the SOT, SOTA accurately recovered the true change point of the HR, with relative errors predominantly within Â± 5% and coverage probabilities exceeding 95% across all scenarios. In the meta-analysis, 25 RCTs were included after screening. The estimated SOT was 3.64 months for overall survival (OS) and 3.26 months for progression-free survival (PFS). The corresponding post-onset HRs for OS and PFS were 0.68 and 0.47, respectively.\nPD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors show a unique delayed effect compared to chemotherapy. The SOTA algorithm provides a quantitative framework for assessing this delay, offering valuable insights for estimating treatment effects and clinical trial design.",
