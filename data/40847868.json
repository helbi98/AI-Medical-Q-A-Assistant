  "abstract": "Aim: To study the prognostic value of biomarkers in patients with heart failure of ischemic origin with concomitant atrial fibrillation and diabetes mellitus.\nMaterial and Methods: 398 patients with heart failure (HF) on the background of post-infarction cardiosclerosis (198 women and 200 men) were included in the study. Patients were divided into 3 groups depending on the HF phenotype: Group I - 167 (42.0%) patients who had reduced LV EF (≤ 40%); II group - 133 (33.4%) patients with moderately reduced LV EF (41-49%); Group III - 98 (24.6%) patients with preserved LV EF (≥ 50%).\nResults: In HF patients with reduced LVEF, compared to patients who had moderately reduced and preserved FE, IV FK according to NYHA and AF are more often diagnosed 70.1%, against 53.4% and 38.8%; c2 = 25.57, p = 0.0001); higher one-year mortality (12.0%, against 1.5% and 4.1%), approximately the same frequency of RH; higher levels of NT-proBNP (by 16.2%, at p = 0.015) and ST-2 (43.0 [38.3 - 47.3] ng/ml, against 41.0 [35.8 - 44.6 ] ng/ml and 41.2 [37.0 - 44.6] ng/ml, with p = 0.004). The NT-proBNP / BNP ratio > 10.17 AU had a higher prognostic value compared to NT-proBNP for PG.\nConclusions: In patients with heart failure of ischemic genesis with concomitant atrial fibrillation and diabetes mellitus, the NT-proBNP /ST-2 ratio >17.12 AU has the greatest prognostic value (Se=85.1%; Sp=80.0%). The frequency of RH in this group reaches 97.6% during the year.",
