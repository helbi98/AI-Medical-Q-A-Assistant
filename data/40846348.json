  "title": "Large Patent Ductus Arteriosus in an Adult With Severe Pulmonary Hypertension and Polycythemia: PDA With Severe Pulmonary Hypertension.",
  "abstract": "Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is one of the most common cardiac abnormalities in children, but in rare cases it can go undiagnosed into adulthood until symptoms arise.\nWe present a unique case of a 55-year-old male patient with severe pulmonary hypertension and polycythemia vera requiring frequent phlebotomy who was found to have a PDA on cardiac computed tomography. Owing to the severity of his pulmonary hypertension, he was not a candidate for closure and was therefore treated with medical management.\nPDA diagnosed in adulthood is rare and carries significant morbidity, with findings such as congestive heart failure, infectious endarteritis, or severe pulmonary hypertension. Our patient had multiple severe and rare sequelae of a very large unrepaired PDA, including Eisenmenger syndrome and polycythemia vera, that required frequent phlebotomy. Despite the large size of the PDA, it was not visualized on echocardiography.",
