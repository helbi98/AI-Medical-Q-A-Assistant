  "abstract": "We present a complex case highlighting the importance of a multi-disciplinary approach to reach a diagnosis of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. We describe an unexpected complication from high-dose steroids, inducing a tumour lysis-like syndrome. Very limited similar cases have been reported in non-malignant patients, leading us to question how we could alter our practice to anticipate patients who are at higher risk of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) in our eosinophilic respiratory patient cohort by extrapolating on known TLS risk factors.<sup>1</sup>.",
