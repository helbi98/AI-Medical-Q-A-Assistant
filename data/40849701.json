  "title": "Association of Interleukin-27 (IL-27) rs181206 T/C and rs17855750 T/G Gene Polymorphisms and the Risk of Hepatitis B Infection among Egyptians.",
  "abstract": "HBsAg incidence in Egypt is at a range of 2 to 7%. Antiviral immunity is linked to interleukin-27 (IL27), a cytokine that is produced by two genes: EBI3 and p28. IL-27 gene SNPs can alter the susceptibility to infection of HVB by impacting the production and/or function of cytokines. The study aimed to examine the impact of the IL-27 SNPs on the progression of HBV infection among Egyptian individuals.\nThis study included a total 112 patients infected with HBV, and 50 healthy individuals served as controls. The link between the IL-27 SNPs (rs181206 T/C and rs17855750 T/G) and HBV was investigated using real-time PCR.\nThere was no significant correlation between fibrosis stages and the distribution of IL-27 rs181206 T/C and rs17855750 T/G genotypes among HBV patients. Results indicated minimal disparity in the distribution of haplotypes among the study groups. No significant difference in the frequency of the CG, CT, TT, TG, and haplotypes between the groups.\nThis study found no correlation between the presence of IL-27 rs1812006 and IL-27 rs17855750 SNPs and the HBV chronicity.",
