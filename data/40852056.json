  "abstract": "Primary intracranial melanomas are an extremely rare entity and are a diagnosis of exclusion. Malignant melanoma represents the third most common site for cerebral metastasis. We hereby narrate a comprehensive and detailed case of metastatic intracranial melanomas with BRAF mutation, which later on had an extensive systemic spread. The imaging differentials include metastasis, intracranial hemorrhage, or granuloma. The final and definitive diagnosis was attained by detailed clinical, histological, and immunohistochemical evaluation as metastatic malignant pigmented tumor consistent with intracranial melanoma.",
