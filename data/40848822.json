  "title": "Inflammatory Cell Death and Leukemia Treatment.",
  "abstract": "The process of inflammatory cell death maintains vital functions in immune surveillance as well as controls tissue balance mechanisms and it serves to advance hematological malignancies including leukemia. Blood cancer leukemia develops from problematic hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that create acute and chronic subgroup variations by their cell origin and disease development. The mechanisms of inflammatory cell death through pyroptosis together with necroptosis and ferroptosis regulate leukemia development and therapeutic approaches. Under chronic inflammation, pyroptosis functions as an inflammatory cell death process with dependent caspase activation, which both suppresses tumor growth and aids leukemogenic processes. During necroptosis, cell death the proteins RIPK1 and RIPK3 function together, to create an alternative death pathway in leukemia cells that resist apoptosis while having potential for future therapeutic development. Ferroptosis offers new possibilities to eliminate leukemia cells that do not respond to standard therapeutic approaches through its iron-dependent mechanism of lipid peroxidation. Learning about molecular pathway controls allows researchers to create better resistance overcome strategies and innovative therapeutic methods. In this review, Therapeutic strategies for leukemia treatment centered on inflammatory cell death receive additional focus together with examination of combination treatments and immunological response modifications and individualized therapeutic methods. Medical treatments for leukemia will advance through the application of these cell death mechanisms with the purpose of achieving better results and overcoming treatment resistance.",
