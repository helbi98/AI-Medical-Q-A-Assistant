  "title": "ESR Essentials: lung cancer screening with low-dose CT-practice recommendations by the European Society of Thoracic Imaging.",
  "abstract": "Low-dose CT screening for lung cancer reduces the risk of death from lung cancer by at least 21% in high-risk participants and should be offered to people aged between 50 and 75 with at least 20 pack-years of smoking. Iterative reconstruction or deep learning algorithms should be used to keep the effective dose below 1 mSv. Deep learning algorithms are required to facilitate the detection of nodules and the measurement of their volumetric growth. Only large solid nodules larger than 500 mm<sup>3</sup> or those with spiculations, bubble-like lucencies, or pleural indentation and complex cysts should be investigated further. Short-term follow-up at 3 or 6 months is required for solid nodules of 100 to 500 mm<sup>3</sup>. A watchful waiting approach is recommended for most subsolid nodules, to limit the risk of overtreatment. Finally, the description of additional findings must be limited if LCS is to be cost-effective. KEY POINTS: Low-dose CT screening reduces the risk of death from lung cancer by at least 21% in high-risk individuals, with a greater benefit in women. Quality assurance of screening is essential to control radiation dose and the number of false positives. Screening with low-dose CT scans detects incidental findings of variable clinical relevance, only those of importance should be reported.",
