  "abstract": "Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a common, disabling manifestation of Parkinson's disease (PD) and a substantial driver of discomfort and functional disability. Clinicians caring for people with PD benefit from a working knowledge of many different treatment options for PD with OH, including medications and nonpharmacological treatments. This review provides clinicians a working understanding of PD OH management strategies that may help them in clinical practice. This includes a summary of clinical features, pathophysiological considerations, pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments, and a proposed integrated approach to the PD patient with OH.",
