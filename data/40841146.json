  "title": "Natural disasters and respiratory health.",
  "abstract": "Natural disasters-including heatwaves, wildfires, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions-significantly impact respiratory health, posing heightened risks to vulnerable populations such as individuals with pre-existing conditions, children, and the elderly. This review explores the complex relationship between natural catastrophes and respiratory health, emphasising the roles of chemical pollutants, biocontaminants, and meteorological factors.Epidemiological evidence highlights alarming trends, including increased asthma exacerbations, COPD hospitalisations, and respiratory infections following these events. During heatwaves, elevated ozone levels, and emissions from power generation for air conditioning exacerbate respiratory conditions, while fine and ultrafine particulate matter (PM), particularly during dust storms and wildfires, emerge as a major contributor to respiratory morbidity and mortality. Volcanic eruptions release hazardous gases, corrosive minerals, and plumes of particles and dust into the atmosphere, which exacerbate symptoms in individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions. Thunderstorms often increase airborne pollen and mould concentrations, triggering episodes of thunderstorm asthma. Earthquake-damaged buildings are significant sources of dust, worsening respiratory symptoms among affected populations. Floods are the origin of mould proliferation, responsible for asthma and other respiratory diseases. First responders, such as firefighters, face acute and potentially chronic respiratory issues due to prolonged exposure to chemical pollutants and biocontaminants during rescue operations. Marginalised communities disproportionately bear the brunt of these health impacts due to systemic vulnerabilities and limited adaptive capacities.This review underscores the escalating respiratory health threats posed by natural disasters amid ongoing climate change. An integrated approach is needed to address these challenges through improved understanding, targeted interventions, and proactive measures to mitigate risks.",
