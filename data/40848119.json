  "title": "Impact of a Care Bundle on Surgical Site Infections and Patient Comfort in Bariatric Surgery: A Randomized Prospective Study.",
  "abstract": "This study evaluated the impact of an evidence-based care bundle on surgical site infection (SSI) rates and patient comfort in bariatric surgery.\nThis randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a control group enrolled patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy at a private hospital in Kayseri, Turkey between June 2023 and September 2023. A total of 93 patients were enrolled, 46 in the experimental group and 47 in the control group. The experimental group implemented the SSI prevention care bundle, while the control group received standard care. Data were collected in three phases: (1) preoperatively, (2) postoperatively until discharge, and (3) on day 30 postoperatively, with the final phase conducted by telephone. Comfort was measured within the first 8 h after surgery. Physiological parameters were assessed at all time points, and biochemical outcomes were monitored pre- and postoperatively.\nThe study demonstrated a reduction in the superficial SSI rate from 7.52% in the control group to 2.15% in the intervention group (p = 0.074). The results suggest a marginally significant trend toward reduced SSIs in the intervention group. The intervention group showed a slightly higher comfort score. Identified risk factors for SSI included smoking, alcohol use, drainage, low preoperative hemoglobin, total bilirubin > 1, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Among hyperglycemic patients, SSI occurred in 4 out of 18 patients in the control group, whereas normoglycemia was achieved in 12 hyperglycemic patients in the intervention group, with no cases of SSI observed (p > 0.05).\nSSI bundle implementation lowered infection rates and improved comfort.\nThis article followed the CONSORT 2010 checklist guidelines for reporting randomized controlled trials.\nThe trial has been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05930639).",
