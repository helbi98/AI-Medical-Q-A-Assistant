  "title": "Sexual and Reproductive Health Care Receipt Among Male Adolescents and Young Adults With Disabilities: Analysis of National Survey of Family Growth Data, 2011-2019.",
  "abstract": "Most research on sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care has focused on women with disabilities, leaving gaps in understanding SRH care among male adolescents and young adults. This study examines the associations of disability status and type with SRH service receipt among young males in the United States METHODS: We analyzed 2011-2019 data from the National Survey of Family Growth, focusing on males aged 15-25 years (n = 7,479). We used Chi-square tests and modified Poisson regression to explore SRH care receipt by disability among sexually active males, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics.\nWe found that, overall, young males with disabilities were more likely than those without disabilities to say their doctor had asked them about sexual orientation and number of sexual partners. However, those with sensory or physical disabilities were less likely to have been asked about condom use (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.84-0.85). Receipt of HIV testing differed by age group; disabled young adults ages 22-25 were more likely than nondisabled peers to have been tested (aPR 1.31; 95% CI: 1.30-1.31), while disabled youth in other age categories were less likely to have received testing than nondisabled youth in the same age group (age 15-18 aPR 0.95; 95% CI: 0.94-0.97; age 19-21 aPR 0.96; 95% CI: 0.95-0.96).\nYoung men with disabilities experience different patterns of SRH care than those without disabilities. Our findings suggest that, while some aspects of SRH dialog are more likely to occur for young men with disabilities, barriers remain in accessing comprehensive SRH services.",
