  "title": "Moving forward together: collaborative strategies in HIV prevention across Africa - a narrative review.",
  "abstract": "HIV remains a major public health challenge across Africa, with the region accounting for nearly 70% of the global HIV burden. Despite significant advances in HIV prevention, treatment, and care, the epidemic continues to disproportionately affect certain populations, exacerbating health disparities and posing a barrier to socioeconomic development. This narrative review explores collaborative strategies in HIV prevention across Africa, focusing on multi-sectoral approaches, community-based interventions, and international partnerships. The review emphasizes the critical role of local communities, healthcare systems, and government organizations in reducing HIV transmission, with a particular focus on the importance of tailored prevention programs for vulnerable populations. Key strategies highlighted in the review include the integration of HIV prevention into broader public health initiatives, such as reproductive health, education, and poverty reduction programs. Community-based interventions, especially those involving community health workers (CHWs) and peer education, have proven effective in reaching at-risk populations. Additionally, international partnerships and funding from organizations like PEPFAR and the Global Fund have been instrumental in scaling up HIV prevention efforts, providing essential resources and technical support. Regional collaborations, such as those between neighboring countries in East and Southern Africa, have also played a vital role in addressing cross-border transmission and providing services to migrant populations.",
