  "abstract": "mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases prevent diseases by stimulating the body to produce specific immune responses through mRNA molecules encoding pathogenic proteins. Compared to traditional vaccines (e.g., inactivated, live attenuated, subunit, recombinant protein and viral vectors), mRNA vaccines offer several advantages including high safety, potent efficacy, scalable large-scale production, and cost-effectiveness. mRNA vaccines have demonstrated significant potential in combating infectious diseases since their inception. In particular, during the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the mRNA vaccines delivered with lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been developed by BioNTech and Moderna, their exceptional protective efficacy and extensive clinical application further proved the rapid responsiveness of mRNA vaccines in addressing emerging infectious diseases. This success has brought mRNA vaccines back into the spotlight of the scientific community. This article reviews the molecular biological basis, delivery systems, and immune mechanisms of mRNA vaccines, as well as the progress of research and clinical trials related to mRNA vaccines targeting the COVID-19 virus, influenza virus, rabies virus, Zika virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosisÂ (M.tb), while also discussing the current challenges faced in the application of mRNA vaccines. These discussions provide a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for the future development of mRNA vaccines targeting bacterial infectious diseases such as tuberculosis (TB).",
