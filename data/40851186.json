  "title": "Exploring learning barriers and limitations among RN-to-BSN students in the post-COVID era: A mixed-methods study.",
  "abstract": "To explore the preferences and barriers to learning that impacted degree completion of students in an RN-to-BSN program after the COVID-19 pandemic, and compare the results with pre-COVID literature on this topic.\nThe study was conducted at a public university and employed an electronic survey.\nResults revealed that pedagogic preferences and competing obligations impacted student outcomes.\nRN-to-BSN students often have multiple competing obligations not shared by \"typical\" traditional students. These students value off-hours support from and connection with the faculty. Further studies involving RN-to-BSN programs across the nation would be beneficial to gain a deeper understanding of these students' challenges.",
