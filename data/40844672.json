  "title": "The P2X7 receptor in leukemia: pathological mechanisms and therapeutic potential.",
  "abstract": "The P2X7 receptor is a trimeric ion channel purinergic receptor. It plays a crucial part in the pathophysiology of cancers and a variety of inflammatory diseases and is widely expressed in different cell types. Leukemia represents a type of malignant clonal disorder that impacts the hematopoietic stem cells. Chemotherapy is one of the main treatment methods for leukemia, but there are also many side effects. In recent years, targeted therapy is a new treatment method. Research has shown that the progression and occurrence of leukemia is significantly related to the P2X7 receptor. The P2X7 receptor is also involved in the migration and invasion of leukemia cells. Furthermore, the polymorphism of the P2X7 receptor gene also takes on a significant function in the occurrence, development and clinical course of leukemia patients. The P2X7 receptor inhibitors have been found to work better in combination with existing therapeutics. Therefore, the P2X7 receptor may serve as a potential therapeutic target.",
