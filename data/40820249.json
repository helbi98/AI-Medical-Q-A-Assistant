  "abstract": "To investigate chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection's effect on gestational liver function, pregnancy and delivery complications, and neonatal development.\nA total of 157 HCV antibody-positive (anti-HCV[+]) and HCV RNA(+) patients (Group C) and 121 anti-HCV(+) and HCV RNA(-) patients (Group B) were included as study participants, while 142 anti-HCV(-) and HCV RNA(-) patients (Group A) were the control group. Data on biochemical indices during pregnancy, pregnancy complications, delivery-related information, and neonatal complications were also collected.\nElevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) rates in Group C during early, middle, and late pregnancy were 59.87%, 43.95%, and 42.04%, respectively-significantly higher than Groups B (26.45%, 15.70%, 10.74%) and A (23.94%, 19.01%, 6.34%) ( <i>P</i> < 0.05). Median ALT levels in Group C were significantly higher than in Groups A and B at all pregnancy stages ( <i>P</i> < 0.05). No significant differences were found in neonatal malformation rates across groups ( <i>P</i> > 0.05). However, neonatal jaundice incidence was significantly greater in Group C (75.16%) compared to Groups A (42.25%) and B (57.02%) ( <i>Ï‡</i> <sup>2</sup> = 33.552, <i>P</i> < 0.001). HCV RNA positivity during pregnancy was an independent risk factor for neonatal jaundice ( <i>OR</i> = 2.111, 95% <i>CI</i> 1.242-3.588, <i>P</i> = 0.006).\nChronic HCV infection can affect the liver function of pregnant women, but does not increase the pregnancy or delivery complication risks. HCV RNA(+) is an independent risk factor for neonatal jaundice.",
