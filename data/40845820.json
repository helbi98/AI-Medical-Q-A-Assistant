  "title": "High-quality marriage mitigates psychological distress in caregivers of older inpatients with severe COPD: A moderated mediation model.",
  "abstract": "Family caregivers play a crucial role in reinforcing health and social care systems. This study aims to explore the psychological distress of older spouse caregivers of inpatients with severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and to reveal the underlying mechanisms by which high quality marital quality alleviates psychological distress. We included 148 older spouse caregivers in this study and found that over half reported experiencing varying degrees of psychological distress. Furthermore, the gender of older spouse caregivers moderates the strength of the relationship between marital quality and psychological distress, which is mediated by caregiver confidence. These findings contribute to our understanding by clarifying the key mechanisms underlying the relationship between marital quality and psychological distress. Therefore, professionals should focus on promoting positive marital quality and caregiver confidence among older spouse caregivers, particularly female caregivers, who may benefit from tailored mental health interventions.",
