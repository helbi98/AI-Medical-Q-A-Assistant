  "abstract": "Accurate patient self-assessment of catheter exit-site conditions is vital to prevent catheter-related infections (CRI) and ensure effective treatment in patients with peritoneal dialysis (PD). This study aimed to evaluate the concordance between PD patients' self-assessment of their catheter exit-site conditions and that of healthcare professionals and to analyze the trend in concordance.\nA prospective observational study was conducted on 44 patients who started PD. The patients were assessed monthly using an exit-site scoring system. Questionnaires were used for patients' self-assessments. The concordance between both evaluations was analyzed over 12â€‰months.\nThe mean concordance rate between patient self-assessments and healthcare professional evaluations was 88%. The concordance rate was higher when no abnormalities were detected (93.8%) and lower when abnormalities were detected (63.2%), decreasing over time in both cases.\nOverall, a high concordance was observed between patient and healthcare professional assessments of PD catheter exit sites. However, the concordance was lower when abnormalities were present and tended to decrease over time, highlighting the potential need for continuous patient education to maintain accurate self-assessment.\nUMIN000037871 and 000039224.",
