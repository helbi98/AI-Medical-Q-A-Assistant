  "title": "Feasibility, Acceptability, and Utility of Remote Patient-Reported Outcomes Monitoring in Patients With Lung Cancer: A Moovcare© Study.",
  "abstract": "Remote symptom monitoring using electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) during cancer care provides clinical benefits. We assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of a web application (Moovcare®) for lung cancer care.\nIn this single-site study (NCT05011890), patients with lung cancer (n = 41) were enrolled to 6 months of weekly symptom reporting using Moovcare®. Oncology providers received alerts for concerning symptoms and accessed graphical reports. Feasibility was operationalized as the median percentage of ePROs completed per patient (threshold: ≥65%). Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and satisfaction with treatment team were assessed at enrollment and 6 months. Clinician acceptability and utility were evaluated with a survey after 6 months of use.\nParticipants averaged 61.5 years of age, and most were female (61.0%), White (73.2%), and had advanced NSCLC (87.8%). The median weekly ePRO completion rate was 76% (IQR: 40%-96%). Alerts occurred in 32/41 (78.0%) of patients, with a mean of 4.2 alerts (95% CI, 2.7-5.69). Clinicians closed alerts in 2.7 (SD 4.0) days. HRQOL was largely unchanged, and satisfaction with provider communication was high. Clinicians (n = 3) felt there was value in symptom monitoring, but electronic health record integration would improve utility. Two out of 3 providers would use the system again and recommend it to others.\nRemote symptom monitoring was feasible for patients with lung cancer. While symptoms were commonly reported, provider perceptions of alert utility were low. Adjusting alert criteria to highlight actionable symptoms and increasing ePRO use in patients with low participation may increase future utility.\nNCT05011890.",
