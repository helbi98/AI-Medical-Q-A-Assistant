  "title": "HIV preexposure prophylaxis education in adult-gerontology primary care and family nurse practitioner programs: A cross-sectional study.",
  "abstract": "Engaging primary care providers in HIV prevention, particularly through the use of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), is essential to ending the HIV epidemic.\nTo assess the extent to which PrEP education is included in family nurse practitioner (FNP) and adult-gerontology primary care nurse practitioner (AGPCNP-AG) program curricula and the level of knowledge program leaders have regarding PrEP.\nAn internet survey was distributed between January and June 2024 to program leaders from 463 US institutions offering AGPCNP and/or FNP programs. The survey examined participants' familiarity with PrEP and whether PrEP was included in each program's curriculum. Participants rated their agreement with statements across 3 exploratory PrEP care domains: (1) effectiveness, impact, and access, (2) safety and risks, and (3) clinical practice and patient management.\nOf the 188 institutions represented in the sample, 84% reported addressed PrEP in their curriculum. However, only 67% could correctly identify the clinical indications for PrEP, and just 18% identified all 3 Food and Drug Administration-approved PrEP medications. Exploratory analysis of Likert-style PrEP beliefs items revealed variability in perceptions of PrEP among faculty respondents that could affect curriculum.\nAlthough PrEP is addressed in U.S. FNP and AGPCNP-AG programs, gaps in faculty knowledge remain, particularly concerning its clinical indications and approved medications. These knowledge gaps could hinder the integration of PrEP into primary care practice.\nFreely available resources, such as online modules and expert-led webinars, could be an effective strategy to augment PrEP education in the classroom.",
