  "title": "Remote spatial memory deficits in mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders with immature dentate gyrus phenotype.",
  "abstract": "The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is a critical region that contributes to recent and remote memory. Granule cells within this region, in which adult neurogenesis occurs, undergo dynamic and reversible maturation via genetic and environmental factors during adulthood. A pseudo-immature state of DG granule cells, called immature DG (iDG), has been observed in the adult mice of certain mutant strains, which are considered animal models of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, such as intellectual disability, schizophrenia, autism, and Alzheimer's disease. However, the association between the iDG phenotype and recent and remote memories in the mouse models remains unclear.\nWe assessed spatial memory in the Barnes circular maze task in five mutant mouse models of the disorders with the iDG phenotype, including Camk2a heterozygous knockout (HET KO), forebrain-specific Calcineurin conditional KO (cKO), Neurogranin KO, and Hivep2 (Schnurri-2) KO, and hAPP-J20 transgenic mice.\nCamk2a HET KO mice and J20 mice spent less time around the target than their wild-type control mice in the memory retention tests one day and four weeks after the last training session. Calcineurin cKO, Neurogranin KO, and Schnurri-2 KO mice showed no significant differences in the time spent around the target from wild-type mice in the retention test 1 day after the training session, but those mutants spent less time around the target than their wild-type mice in the retest conducted four weeks later.\nThese results indicated that mouse models of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders exhibiting the iDG phenotype demonstrate a common behavioral characteristic of remote spatial memory deficits, suggesting the potential involvement of the pseudo-immature state of DG granule cells in remote memory dysfunction.",
