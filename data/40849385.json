  "title": "Analysis of the 2024 Breast Surgical Oncology Fellowship Match: Survey of Applicants' and Program Directors' Preferences Regarding In-Person Versus Virtual Interviews.",
  "abstract": "In 2020, in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Breast Surgical Oncology (BSO) fellowship programs transitioned to virtual interviews; however, for the 2024 cycle, programs selected either virtual or in-person interviews with applicants participating in potentially both formats. Following the match, a survey was performed to evaluate experiences among applicants and program directors (PDs).\nSurveys were developed within the BSO Fellowship Program Directors Committee and distributed via email to matched applicants and PDs from 18 July 2024 to 9 August 2024. Descriptive statistics were conducted.\nOf the 89 matched applicants, 60 completed the survey (response rate 67.4%). Most applicants (76.7%, n = 46) preferred in-person over virtual interviews. The top reason for preferring in-person was 'to see the program in person' (56.7%, n = 34). Nearly half of applicants (48.3%, n = 29) estimated spending ≥$5000 on interviews, and 78.3% (n = 47) indicated the cost was 'worth it'. Over half of applicants (51.7%, n = 31) reported interview style had an impact on their match. Of the 64 PDs, 38 completed the survey (response rate 59.4%). Virtual interviews were the most common format (65.8%, n = 25). The most important factor reported by most programs regarding the interview approach was cost to applicants (42.1%, n = 16). Over half of PDs (52.6%, n = 20) felt the interview approach influenced the match.\nThe majority of 2024 BSO fellowship matched applicants preferred in-person interviews, noting the importance of location, faculty, and culture to their decision making. This data may assist PDs in choosing the interview approach best suited for their programs and guide training programs more broadly.",
