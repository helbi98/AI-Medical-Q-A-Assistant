  "title": "Covid-19 diagnosis using privacy-preserving data monitoring: an explainable AI deep learning model with blockchain security.",
  "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic emphasised necessity for prompt, precise diagnostics, secure data storage, and robust privacy protection in healthcare. Existing diagnostic systems often suffer from limited transparency, inadequate performance, and challenges in ensuring data security and privacy. The research proposes a novel privacy-preserving diagnostic framework, Heterogeneous Convolutional-recurrent attention Transfer learning based ResNeXt with Modified Greater Cane Rat optimisation (HCTR-MGR), that integrates deep learning, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), and blockchain technology. The HCTR model combines convolutional layers for spatial feature extraction, recurrent layers for capturing spatial dependencies, and attention mechanisms to highlight diagnostically significant regions. A ResNeXt-based transfer learning backbone enhances performance, while the MGR algorithm improves robustness and convergence. A trust-based permissioned blockchain stores encrypted patient metadata to ensure data security and integrity and eliminates centralised vulnerabilities. The framework also incorporates SHAP and LIME for interpretable predictions. Experimental evaluation on two benchmark chest X-ray datasets demonstrates superior diagnostic performance, achieving 98-99% accuracy, 97-98% precision, 95-97% recall, 99% specificity, and 95-98% F1-score, offering a 2-6% improvement over conventional models such as ResNet, SARS-Net, and PneuNet. These results underscore the framework's potential for scalable, secure, and clinically trustworthy deployment in real-world healthcare systems.",
