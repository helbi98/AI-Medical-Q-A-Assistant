  "title": "Clinical Study of Drug Therapy Combined With Scraping in Patients With Primary Parkinson Disease.",
  "abstract": "Scraping is a nondrug treatment method of traditional Chinese medicine, which has potential advantages for treating nervous system disorders.\nTo confirm the clinical effect of drug therapy combined with scraping on primary PD, 120 patients with primary PD from March 2020 to March 2022 were chosen as the research objects. The control group (n=60) was treated with simple Traditional Western Pharmacological Treatment. In the combined treatment group (n=60), scraping therapy was added based on drug therapy. The MDS-UPDRS Ⅲ score, nonmotor symptom scale (NMSS) score, IL-6 and IL-1β levels, and clinical efficacy were compared between the 2 groups to determine the advantages of combined treatment. After 3 courses of treatment, the MDS-UPDRS Ⅲ scores, NMSS scores, and the expression of IL-1β and IL-6 were lower than those before treatment (P<0.05).\nThis result was also confirmed by analyzing the results at 1 month of follow-up. At the same time, the scores of MDS-UPDRS Ⅲ and NMSS and the levels of IL-1β and IL-6 in the combined treatment patients were lower than those in the control group (P<0.05).\nThe combined treatment group's clinical effect was better after treatment than the control group. These findings represent preliminary evidence that scraping in combination with medication can be beneficial for the treatment of primary PD in the early to middle stages. Although it's promising to show overall improvements in motor dysfunction and nonmotor symptoms, further investigation with larger studies is needed to evaluate these effects further.",
