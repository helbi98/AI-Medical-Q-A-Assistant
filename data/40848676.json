  "abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection and a leading cause of anal cancer and genital warts, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM). In Hong Kong, HPV vaccination is currently only offered to school-aged girls, despite the high burden of HPV-related diseases among MSM, especially those living with HIV. Existing cost-effectiveness evaluations of HPV vaccination in Hong Kong primarily focus on female-only strategies and heterosexual men without accounting for differences in HPV infection risks among MSM. In contrast, countries such as the United Kingdom initially implemented free HPV vaccination for MSM through sexual health clinics, followed by an expansion of the programme to include adolescent boys. This provides a potentially useful model for Hong Kong to consider. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of implementing 9-valent HPV (9vHPV) vaccination strategies among HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM in Hong Kong.\nWe developed a Markov model to simulate the natural history of HPV infection and progression to genital warts, and anal cancer in a cohort of 100,000 MSM in Hong Kong, stratified by four age groups (12-18, 19-27, 28-45, and > 45 years) and HIV status (positive or negative). A 10-year time horizon was used from the healthcare provider's perspective. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the results.\nModelled incidence rates of anal cancer and anogenital warts were significantly reduced following the implementation of 9vHPV vaccine strategies. Vaccinating all MSM aged ≥12 years prevented the most anogenital warts (52.5 %) and anal cancer cases (70.4 %). Across all MSM vaccination strategies assessed, the ICERs were below the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of USD 50,696 per QALY gained (one-time Hong Kong GDP per capita) or cost-saving, indicating that all 9vHPV strategies were cost-effective. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the vaccination strategy for MSM aged ≥12 years consistently demonstrated a high probability of being cost-effective. Furthermore, when the cost of the 9vHPV vaccine decreased or the time horizon was extended, the ICERs for vaccinating MSM aged ≥12 years further declined, making the strategy more cost-effective.\nOur findings support the implementation of 9vHPV vaccination for MSM in Hong Kong, with vaccinating all MSM aged ≥12 years offering the greatest health and economic benefits.",
