  "title": "Family history of fracture and fracture risk: a meta-analysis to update the FRAXÂ® risk assessment tool.",
  "abstract": "In the largest meta-analysis of international cohorts to date, a family history of fracture is confirmed as a significant BMD-independent predictor of future fracture risk. Parental and sibling histories of fracture carry the same significance for future fracture, including the impact of family hip fracture on future hip fracture risk.\nWe have undertaken a meta-analysis of international prospective cohorts to quantify the relationship between a family history of fracture and future fracture incidence.\nThe analysis dataset comprised 350,542 men and women from 42 cohorts in 29 countries followed for 2.8 million person-years. We investigated the relationship between family history of hip fracture or any fracture and the risk of any clinical fracture, any osteoporotic fracture, major osteoporotic fracture (MOF), and hip fracture alone using an extended Poisson model in each cohort. Models were adjusted for current age, sex, BMD, and follow-up time.\nAs no difference in influence of family history of fracture was seen between genders, results are presented for men and women combined. A parental history of hip fracture was associated with a higher risk of incident fracture across all fracture outcome categories, with a stronger relationship with future hip fracture (hazard ratios (HR, 95% CI) for hip and MOF 1.37, 1.23-1.52 and 1.19, 1.12-1.27, respectively). Associations were slightly reduced but remained significant when additionally adjusted for BMD and did not vary by baseline offspring age, follow-up time, or parent affected. In a more limited analysis, parental history of any fracture or a sibling history of hip or any fracture showed similar associations to those observed with parental history of hip fracture.\nA family history of fracture is confirmed as a significant BMD-independent predictor of future fracture risk. While parental hip fracture appears the strongest factor for future hip fracture, a family history of other fractures might be appropriate for inclusion in future iterations of the FRAX tool.",
