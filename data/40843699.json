  "title": "A Series of Severe and Critical COVID-19 Cases in Hospitalized, Unvaccinated Children: Clinical Findings and Hospital Care.",
  "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly transformed social life worldwide, indiscriminately affecting individuals across all age groups. Children have not been exempted from the risk of severe illness and death caused by COVID-19.\nThis paper sought to describe the clinical findings, laboratory and imaging results, and hospital care provided for severe and critical cases of COVID-19 in unvaccinated children, with or without severe asthma, hospitalized in a public referral service for COVID-19 treatment in the Brazilian state of Pernambuco.\nThis was a case series study of severe and critical COVID-19 in hospitalized, unvaccinated children, with or without severe asthma, conducted in a public referral hospital between March 2020 and June 2021.\nThe case series included 80 children, aged from 1 month to 11 years, with the highest frequency among those under 2 years old (58.8%) and a predominance of males (65%). Respiratory diseases, including severe asthma, were present in 73.8% of the cases. Pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome occurred in 15% of the children, some of whom presented with cardiac involvement. Oxygen therapy was required in 65% of the cases, mechanical ventilation in 15%, and 33.7% of the children required intensive care in a pediatric intensive care unit. Pulmonary infiltrates and ground-glass opacities were common findings on chest X-rays and CT scans; inflammatory markers were elevated, and the most commonly used medications were antibiotics, bronchodilators, and corticosteroids.\nThis case series has identified key characteristics of children with severe and critical COVID-19 during a period when vaccines were not yet available in Brazil for the study age group. However, the persistence of low vaccination coverage, largely due to parental vaccine hesitancy, continues to leave children vulnerable to potentially severe illness from COVID-19. These findings may inform the development of public health emergency contingency plans, as well as clinical protocols and care pathways, which can guide decision-making in pediatric care and ensure appropriate clinical management, ultimately improving the quality of care provided.",
