  "title": "Colorectal cancer patients' experiences with antineoplastic agents from the perspective of their significant others: a longitudinal qualitative study.",
  "abstract": "Colorectal cancer and its treatment deeply impact patients' lives. Significant others, often family members, play crucial pre-existing roles in patients' lives and are closely involved in their care. However, there is limited understanding of the patients' treatment journey from the significant others' perspective.\nTo explore colorectal cancer patients' experiences with antineoplastic agents from the perspective of significant others over 24 weeks.\nThis involved a longitudinal qualitative study with 16 significant others nominated by patients with colorectal cancer. Two in-depth interviews were conducted: one at start and another after 24 weeks of treatment. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed by 2 researchers independently.\nFive themes were identified: Patients' perceptions and knowledge of the illness and treatment, the healthcare system in relation to the illness and treatment, patients' involvement in treatment decision-making and their experience of medicine-taking, medicine and illness-related impact on patients and others and personal support structures. Significant others observed that patients initially viewed treatment as curative but later perceived as means to extend life-expectancy. While significant others considered that concerns about aesthetics were initially prominent for the patient, fatigue and peripheral neuropathy became most impactful effects. They considered patients' experiences with cancer services to remain overall positive, particularly regarding personalised support from nurse navigators. Significant others noted that early establishment of support network was crucial for fostering resilience throughout the treatment journey.\nThis study provides insights from significant others highlighting the complex evolution of patients' experiences and importance of establishing a personalised support network early in treatment journey.",
