  "title": "The relationship between hypertension and health-related physical fitness in older adult residences in Wuhan: a cross-sectional study.",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate hypertension-associated disparities in health-related physical fitness (HRPF) among community-dwelling older adults in Wuhan.\nThis cross-sectional study employed multi-stage stratified random sampling: random selection of 7 districts from Wuhan's 17 administrative districts and 3-5 communities per district. A total of 801 eligible adults aged ≥65 years were recruited (after exclusions). The sample size was determined using 2015 municipal census data (α = 0.05, power = 90%). Assessments included verification of hypertension and demographic questionnaires, as well as seven standardized HRPF tests across four domains. The data were analyzed using SPSS 13.0, which involved calculating descriptive statistics (means ± SDs, 95% CIs) and performing between-group comparisons (χ<sup>2</sup> tests and ANOVA).\nHypertensive participants (<i>n</i> = 291) demonstrated impaired dynamic balance: they had reduced One-Leg Balance (OLB) time (3.38 ± 3.30 s vs. 3.98 ± 3.81 s; <i>p</i> = 0.02). Decreased aerobic endurance: fewer 2-min step repetitions (65.62 ± 29.17 vs. 70.13 ± 26.71; <i>p</i> = 0.033). However, they showed enhanced shoulder flexibility: greater back scratch reach (-14.11 ± 12.36 cm vs. -10.47 ± 11.15 cm; <i>p</i> < 0.001).\nHypertension is associated with domain-specific HRPF impairments, particularly in balance and aerobic endurance. Targeted exercise interventions that prioritize these domains may mitigate functional decline and reduce cardiovascular burden in aging populations.",
