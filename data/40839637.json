  "title": "Modeling the formation of a worldwide health network fighting TBC: Key drivers in policy, management and governance in developing countries and global health institutions.",
  "abstract": "We present an original study on the usage of a model of network formation to analyze the X (formerly Twitter) friendship network relative to the health organizations that are fighting a specific infectious disease such as Tuberculosis (TBC) as well as how the network evolves over time. Using this model, that mixes information from social media and the underlying reconstructed economic network of their actors, together with disease incidence information, we can then study how the TBC global health network (GHNs) works. Specifically, we investigate the key drivers of this global network partnerships as well as the interplay between economic, social media, and disease incidence. The network diversity (a measure of node size dispersion), has been identified as the leading feature for the network growth, while improving its resilience. We use these insights to suggest better health strategies especially targeted to weak GHNs operating in low and middle income countries that often lack funding, coordination and the capability to attract new donors.",
