  "title": "Overcoming an underdiagnosed respiratory condition: should more patients with cardiovascular complications be screened for obstructive sleep apnea?",
  "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) - characterized by recurrent upper airway obstruction during sleep - remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Affecting nearly one billion adults globally, OSA is especially prevalent among patients with cardiovascular comorbidities. Diagnosis may be delayed due to atypical symptoms, particularly in women, and systematic healthcare barriers including fragmented care, limited provider training, and restricted access to specialized diagnostics. Untreated OSA contributes to an increased prevalence of resistant hypertension, recurrent arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation), stroke, and heart failure.\nThis review focuses on the intricate relationship between OSA and cardiovascular health, highlighting key pathophysiological mechanisms such as intermittent hypoxia, autonomic dysregulation, and systemic inflammation that drive structural and functional cardiac impairments. Further, the review highlights the importance of improved screening tools with regard to early detection. The special report is based upon a systemic search of the database PubMed for relevant publications on obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease.\nEarly screening and detection are crucial, given the strong association between untreated OSA and adverse health outcomes. Expert consensus recommends routine OSA screening in high-risk cardiovascular populations and emphasizes comprehensive early interventions, including CPAP, lifestyle modification, and metabolic risk management. Integrating OSA assessment into cardiology practice and expanding the use of advanced diagnostic tools may improve detection, reduce morbidity and mortality, and lessen the economic burden on healthcare systems.",
