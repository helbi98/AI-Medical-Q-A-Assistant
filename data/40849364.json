  "abstract": "Brexucabtagene autoleucel (brexu-cel) is a chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cell therapy approved for adults with relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). We studied the impact of social determinants of health (SDoH) on outcomes of adults with B-ALL receiving brexu-cel. This retrospective analysis included adults (â‰¥18 years) with R/R B-ALL treated with brexu-cel between 2021 and 2023. Cox proportional hazards models evaluated the association of race, ethnicity, and SDoH with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). 189 patients received brexu-cel and 57% were male. 55% were non-Hispanic White, 30% Hispanic, 7% non-Hispanic Black, 6% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 2% other/unknown. 43% were referred from private/community-based practices and 35% lived 50 miles or greater from the CAR T center. Health insurance included public (47%) and private (41%). 31% had a high social deprivation index (SDI, 76-99th percentile). Black race was associated with worse OS (HR 3.48; 95% CI 1.01-12.03). There was no difference in PFS (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.50-2.10) or OS (HR 1.43; 95% CI 0.56-3.65) in Hispanic patients. Outcomes appear independent of SDoH and SDoH did not impact OS. We observed comparable outcomes to non-Hispanic patients.",
