  "title": "Cellular and humoral response after mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in kidney transplant recipients living with HIV: A cross-sectional study.",
  "abstract": "No data exists on responses to mRNA vaccines in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with HIV. We compared these responses in HIV-positive (HIV+KTR+) and negative KTRs (HIV-KTR+), and in people living with HIV (PLWH) without kidney transplantation (HIV+KTR-).\nIn across-sectional study of 33 patients receiving mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, we evaluated the humoral response to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination using a Luminex platform (IgG and IgM), and cellular response with specific T cell response (S-and N- protein) by ELISpot. We used logistic regression models to assess associated factors.\nThe study comprised 11 HIV-KTR+, 11 HIV+KTR+, and 11 HIV+KTR-. PLWH had suppressed viral load on ART. Seroconversion rates were 72.7% among KTRs, with no significant differences between HIV-KTR+ (81.8%) and HIV+KTR+ (63.6%) (P = 0.338). In HIV+KTR-, seroconversion was 100%, higher than HIV+KTR+ (P = 0.027). Cellular response against protein S occurred in 63.6% of cases, regardless of HIV, transplantation, or dose number. Higher age negatively influenced cellular response in HIV+KTR- (OR 0.77, 95%CI 0.60-0.99).\nAlthough cellular immune response was similar across all groups, humoral response was reduced in HIV+KTR+. In HIV+KTR-, age reduced cellular response. These findings enhance our understanding of vaccine response in immunosuppressed populations and aid in optimizing vaccination strategies.",
