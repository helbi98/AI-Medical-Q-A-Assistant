  "title": "Interleukin-13 (rs20541 A/G) Gene Polymorphism and Chance of Acquiring Hepatitis B in the Egyptian Population.",
  "abstract": "An important worldwide health concern is infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV), especially in underdeveloped nations. Gene polymorphisms encoding pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines can influence how an HBV infection presents clinically. As mediators, cytokines play important functions in the immunological and inflammatory systems. A strong pleiotropic cytokine is interleukin-13 (IL-13). The research attempts to look into the relationship between HBV infection in Egyptians and variations in a single nucleotide in the IL-13 (rs20541 A/G) gene.\nOne hundred and twelve hepatitis B cases and fifty control subjects were involved in the investigation. Utilizing an allelic discrimination test pre-validated TaqManâ„¢ MGB probe (Applied Biosystem). To investigate the relationship between the SNP of (IL-13) (rs 20541 A/G) gene and HBV, we used real-time PCR.\nThe IL13 (rs20541 A/G) gene polymorphism study identified more frequent occurrences of the A/G and A/A genotypes among the patients (OR = {62.536, 21.25}, CI = {[19.276-202.889], [3.055-147.8]}, P = {0.0001, 0.002}). In the patient group, the A allele frequency was markedly different from the control group's (CI = 2.614-8.229, OR = 4.638, P < 0.0001). Nevertheless, the current investigation did not find a connection between HBV fibrosis and the gene polymorphism of IL-13(rs 20541 A/G).\nThe rs20541 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in IL-13 gene is linked to an increased risk of HBV.",
