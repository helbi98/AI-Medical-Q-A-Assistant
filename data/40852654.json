  "title": "Patients' knowledge, attitude, and practice toward stroke rehabilitation: a web-based cross-sectional study.",
  "abstract": "The objective of this research was to comprehensively assess how well patients understand stroke rehabilitation, their perceptions of it, and their inclination to participate.\nThis web-based cross-sectional study was conducted between February and June 2023 at the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University, using a self-administered questionnaire.\nA total of 497 valid questionnaires were enrolled, including 342 (68.81%) males. The mean score of knowledge, attitude and practice was 11.79 ± 0.63 (possible range: 0-12), 36.06 ± 2.55 (possible range: 12-60), and 58.24 ± 5.08 (possible range: 14-70), respectively. The results demonstrated that knowledge has a positive and significant direct effect on attitudes (<i>β</i> = 0.249, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and attitudes had direct effects on practice (<i>β</i> = 0.443, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Knowledge had direct (<i>β</i> = 0.124, <i>p</i> = 0.002) and indirect effects (<i>β</i> = 0.111, <i>p</i> < 0.001) on practice.\nStroke patients had sufficient knowledge, unfavorable attitude and positive practice toward stroke and rehabilitation training. This study showed that addressing and enhancing individuals' attitudes could be a key strategy in promoting more positive and effective practice toward stroke and rehabilitation training among stroke patients.",
