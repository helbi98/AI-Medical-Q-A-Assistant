  "title": "Proteomics and Single Cell Profiling Identify Keratin Driven Preexisting Immunity Influences Lung Squamous Carcinoma Neoadjuvant Therapy.",
  "abstract": "Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) demonstrates heterogeneous responses to neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade, necessitating biomarkers for outcome prediction. Here, we identify tumor keratinization as a key determinant of therapeutic resistance. In 470 LUSC patients, elevated serum CYFRA 21-1 correlated with non-complete pathological response (non-CPR), while CK5/6 immunohistochemistry revealed strong association between keratinization and residual tumor burden (R=0.45, P<0.001). Proteomic profiling of 167 treatment-naÃ¯ve biopsies stratified patients into distinct subtypes based on keratinization levels. KRT_L (low keratinization) exhibited enhanced immune infiltration, a markedly lower residual viable tumor percentage (P<0.001), and superior survival outcomes (HR=2.28, P=0.034) compared to the KRT_H (high keratinization). Conversely, KRT_H displayed upregulation of keratin proteins, activation of metabolic pathways, and enhanced cancer stemness features, alongside notable immunosuppression. Single-cell RNA analysis confirmed higher keratinization, metabolism and stemness in non-CPR tumors, with trajectory analysis linking undifferentiated states to keratin overexpression. Through integrated proteomic and single-cell analyses, our findings establish keratinization as a hallmark of immune-cold LUSC microenvironments, mechanistically linking elevated keratin expression with both stemness features and impaired immunotherapy efficacy, proposing keratin-based stratification for personalized therapy.",
