  "title": "Association between 6-min walk test and initiation of home oxygen therapy within 3 years in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed by primary care physicians.",
  "abstract": "In the western area of Yokohama, patients with mild chronic obstructive respiratory disease (COPD) are managed via a coordinated system consisting of St. Marianna University Yokohama Seibu hospital and primary care clinics. In this study, we investigated whether background factors predicted the need for home oxygen therapy (HOT) within three years as a marker of risk for exacerbation and hospitalization.\nOf the 114 COPD patients who were managed via the coordinated system between January 2013 and March 2020, 101 who underwent the 6-min walk test (6MWT) in room air were recruited.\nThe mean age of patients was 76.2 years, and 95 were male. The mean distance covered during the 6MWT (6MWD) was 374 m, and the median lowest SpO<sub>2</sub> during the 6MWT was 93 %. Twenty-two patients dropped out of the study. Eleven patients (10.8 %) required HOT within 3 years. Compared with the 68 patients who did not require HOT, the group requiring HOT was significantly older, covered a had a short 6MWD, had a lower SpO<sub>2</sub>, a lower percentage diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (%DLCO), and a higher right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed a cut off value of 91 % in the lowest SpO<sub>2</sub> for the introduction of HOT within 3 years (Area under the curve: 0.819, sensitivity: 1.0, specificity: 0.633).\nThe 6MWT can be used to assess cardiopulmonary function in COPD and associated with prognosis. 6MWT can be useful predictor of a future need for HOT.",
