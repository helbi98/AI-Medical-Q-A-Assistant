  "abstract": "Genitourinary tuberculosis manifests several years after infection with tuberculosis. It presents with fever, pyuria, weight loss, and loss of appetite. Urine cultures are typically sterile. Within the urinary system it presents with fibrosis and stricture formation. The renal manifestation involves granulomatous interstitial nephritis with or without chronic kidney disease. Renal pseudotumors are a very infrequent manifestation of tuberculosis, which can lead to unnecessary nephrectomies. This case report describes a patient with this odd manifestation of tuberculosis.",
