  "title": "Prevalence of Erectile Dysfunction in Malagasy Patients With Diabetes Mellitus and Its Associations With Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Diseases: A Cross-Sectional Study.",
  "abstract": "Our study aims to determine the prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) and its associations with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in Malagasy patients with diabetes mellitus (DM).\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted over a period of 3 years at the Soavinandriana Hospital Center. Erectile function was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function 5-item version (IIEF-5) questionnaire, with a score of less than 22 indicating ED. The presence of ASCVD was confirmed in cases where carotid atherosclerosis (CAS), lower limb arteriopathy (LLA), coronary heart disease (CHD) and/or ischaemic stroke were present.\nThe study population included 305 patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM). The prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) was 73.4%. According to the bivariate analysis, the risk factors for ED were age ≥ 55 years (odds ratio [OR] 12.0 (6.34-23.4)), hypertension (OR 6.02 (3.27-11.3)), physical inactivity (OR 8.86 (4.85-16.6)), smoking (OR 2.53 (1.32-5.09)), dyslipidemia (OR 4.11 (2.33-7.32)), type 2 DM (OR 8.80 (1.53-91.0)) and diabetes duration ≥ 10 years (OR 2.24 (1.11-4.87)), renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers (OR 6.27 (3.43-11.6)), calcium-channel blockers (OR 3.01 (1.69-5.48)), diuretics (OR 2.14 (1.06-4.66)) and beta-blockers (OR 4.55 (1.85-13.5)). After adjusting for age, hypertension, physical inactivity, smoking and dyslipidemia, ED was significantly associated with ASCVD (OR 1.88 (1.01-3.69)), and CAS (OR 1.89 (1.03-3.22)). Adjusting for age, type and duration of DM, ED was found to be significantly associated with ASCVD (OR 1.91 (1.01-3.58)) and CAS (OR 2.31 (1.11-4.85)). However, there was no statistically significant association between ED, LLA, CHD and ischaemic stroke.\nED was very common and may be a predictor of ASCVD in patients with DM, particularly CAS. Consequently, the presence of ED should prompt the search for ASCVD, and vice versa.",
