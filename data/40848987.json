  "title": "Phenotypes and follow-up of chronic cow's milk Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome: 16-year prospective observational study.",
  "abstract": "Chronic FPIES (cFPIES) is less well characterized than acute form, the clinical features for defining the different clinical phenotypes have not been identified and data on follow-up are lacking.\nto describe a population of infants with cow'milk-chronic FPIES (CM-cFPIES), providing a definition of clinical phenotypes and its evolution between the onset and our observation, and the natural history over time.\nProspective observational study was conducted on all the patients with OFC-diagnosed CM-cFPIES between January 2008 and January 2024. Descriptive analysis is reported.\nThirty-nine patients were included. Neonatal onset was observed in 48.7%. We characterized and identified three clinical phenotypes: severe from the very beginning (16/39, 41%), including 11 newborns; 86% exclusively breastfed patients were part of this group. Mild (17/39, 43.6 %) or moderate (6/39, 15.4%) at the onset, remaining stable over time (n=8) or with progressive worsening (n=15) until severe form. The most prevalent symptom was intermittent vomiting, followed by diarrhea. Bloody stools were almost exclusively reported in newborns. Leukocytosis, neutrophilia and metabolic acidosis were the most frequently observed laboratory features; eosinophil levels were significantly higher in newborns. Imaging was not specific and was misleading in some cases. Atypical CM-cFPIES was observed in 30.7% of patients; multiple FPIES was developed by 28.2%. Overall, 92% outgrew CM-cFPIES, CONCLUSION: Clinical suspect of CM-cFPIES is difficult due to different phenotypes. Neonatal CM-cFPIES presents clinical and laboratory features partly different from those of the infant form. Exclusive breastfeeding might not be a protective factor. CM-cFPIES resolves in most children.",
