  "title": "Cardiovascular contributions to dementia: Examining sex differences and female-specific factors.",
  "abstract": "Growing evidence underscores the importance of cardiovascular contributions to Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD). While sex differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and outcomes are well established, the question of whether vascular contributions to AD/ADRD vary by sex has only recently garnered attention. In this narrative review, we discuss sex differences in conventional CVD risk factors (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes), as well as underrecognized female-specific (e.g., menopause history, polycystic ovary syndrome, adverse pregnancy outcomes) and female-predominant (e.g., autoimmune conditions, breast cancer) CVD risk factors. Despite their relevance, these sex-specific considerations are rarely incorporated into current approaches to quantify CVD risk in AD/ADRD research. We offer recommendations to address these gaps and promote the use of sex-informed methods for studying cardiovascular contributions to AD/ADRD in women, which is essential for developing precision strategies to improve outcomes for all individuals at risk of dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: There are extensive sex differences in cardiovascular risk, dementia risk, and their interrelationships. Many cardiovascular risk factors confer greater risk for dementia in women than men. Existing approaches to quantifying cardiovascular risk often overlook sex differences and female-specific factors. Sex-informed approaches are essential for an accurate understanding of cardiovascular contributions to dementia.",
