  "abstract": "Corni Fructus, a plant with both medicinal and edible properties, is renowned for its aromatic flavor and hepatoprotective and renoprotective effects, offering significant nutritional value and broad application potential. Wine-processed Corni Fructus (WCF) is a primary processed form of Corni Fructus, widely utilized in food supplements. Traditional Chinese medicine suggests that wine-processing enhances its hepatoprotective and renoprotective properties, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.\nIn this study, a novel comprehensive strategy guided by variation in the chemical components and differences in biological activities was developed to explore the wine-processing mechanisms.\nFirstly, the chemical constituents in vitro and in vivo were identified by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Furthermore, chemometric analysis was applied to investigate the chemical characteristics in the samples with different processing methods. The possible molecular mechanism differences were unraveled by network pharmacology.\nA total of 53 and 61 components were identified in vitro of crude Corni Fructus (CCF) and WCF, respectively. In addition, 39 and 43 components were detected in rats' serum after CCF and WCF administered by gavage. Ten common targets were identified as key targets for the therapeutic effects of CCF and WCF on Chronic kidney diseases (CKD). The network analysis showed that 23 components in WCF may be the active substances that make it more effective than CCF for treating CKD.\nThis study provides a theoretical basis for the pharmacological substances of WCF and CCF and gives insights into comparing their pharmacological differences. It further investigates the mechanisms underlying different processing techniques of Corni Fructus, supporting further exploration of its potential in CKD management.\nNot applicable.",
