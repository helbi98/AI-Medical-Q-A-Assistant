  "title": "A Single-Center, Retrospective Comparison of Non-Pre-emptive with Pre-emptive Renal Transplantations.",
  "abstract": "End-stage renal disease (ESRD) requires renal replacement therapy, either through pre-emptive transplantation (PET) or non-pre-emptive transplantation (non-PET). PET is associated with improved patient and allograft survival compared to non-PET; however, only 2.5% of patients in the United States undergo PET. The authors of this study report on mortality and allograft rejection rates in patients undergoing PET versus non-PET.\nThis single-center, retrospective study compared posttransplant complications between PET and non-PET in adults with ESRD. De-identified electronic health record data from 2017 to 2022 were analyzed. Odds ratios (ORs) for one-year post-transplant mortality and allograft rejection were calculated using unadjusted multivariate logistic regression (Model 1), adjusted for age and sex (Model 2), and further adjusted for comorbidities (Model 3).\nA total of 787 patients with ESRD underwent kidney transplantation: 14% underwent non-PET and 86% underwent PET. Compared to PET, the ORs for one-year post-transplant mortality with non-PET were:Model 1: OR 1.76 (95% CI, 0.64-4.85; p = 0.27)Model 2: OR 2.02 (95% CI, 0.71-5.71; p = 0.19)Model 3: OR 1.86 (95% CI, 0.64-5.39; p = 0.24)For one-year allograft rejection, the ORs for non-PET versus PET were:Model 1: OR 1.63 (95% CI, 0.85-3.10; p = 0.13)Model 2: OR 1.61 (95% CI, 0.84-3.06; p = 0.15)Model 3: OR 1.60 (95% CI, 0.82-3.10; p = 0.16).\nThis single-center study found no statistically significant differences in one-year mortality or allograft rejection between patients undergoing PET and non-PET.",
