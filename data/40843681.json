  "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: The concentration of antigen-specific antibodies in serum is usually measured in international units/mL. Therefore, the actual concentration of virus-specific antibodies in sera is unknown. <b>Objectives</b>: The aim of the study was to determine conversion factors for concentrations of IgG against hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs), SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleoprotein (NP) as well as tetanus toxin (Ttx) in serum and to compare antigen-specific IgG concentrations in serum samples. <b>Methods</b>: Absorption equivalence ELISAs were used to determine conversion factors for international units (IU) for anti-HBs, anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD and NP and for anti-Ttx immunoglobulin G. The antigen-specific IgG concentrations in serum samples were then measured in units/mL and the ratio of IgG concentrations in the sera was determined using the conversion factors. <b>Results</b>: One IU of anti-HBs IgG corresponded to 24.4 BAU of anti-CoV-2 RBD IgG, 6.87 BAU of anti-CoV-2 NP and 14 mIU of anti-Ttx IgG. One BAU anti-SARS-CoV-2 NP-specific IgG is equivalent to 3.5 BAU SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG. Conversion of international units showed that median serum anti-Ttx-IgG concentrations were 50 times higher and anti-CoV-2-RBD-IgG concentrations were 390 times higher than median anti-HBs-IgG concentrations. In addition, after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the concentration of NP-specific IgG in serum was generally higher than that of RBD-specific IgG. <b>Conclusions</b>: The study provides conversion factors for serum concentrations of IgG against HBs, SARS-CoV-2 RBD and NP, as well as Ttx-IgG. This offers new insights into serum IgG concentrations and allows conclusions to be drawn about plasma cell pools.",
