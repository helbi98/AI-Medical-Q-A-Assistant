  "title": "Multimodal Therapy Achieves Secondary Prevention LDL-C Targets in LDL-Receptor Null Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia.",
  "abstract": "Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is a rare condition most commonly associated with pathogenic variants in the LDLR gene that leads to mortality before age 20 if not treated.\nA 4-year-old boy of Lebanese origin with multiple skin xanthomas was found to have untreated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of 1005 mg/dL (26 mM). Gene analysis revealed biallelic identical LDLR variants with <2% residual LDLR activity (LDLR-null).\nWith combination therapy including maximum dose rosuvastatin, ezetimibe, plasma exchange, lomitapide, and evinacumab, guideline-recommended LDL-C of <70 mg/dL (1.8 mM) was achieved for secondary prevention of coronary disease. With this combined treatment, there has been no progression of his premature coronary heart disease.\nEffective treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia requires multimodal lipid-lowering therapies. With currently available treatments it is possible to achieve previously unattainable lowering of LDL-C to prevent vascular disease and the need for liver transplantation.",
