  "abstract": "Immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency, a rare, highly heritable trait, is associated with frequent pulmonary infections, emphysema, airway changes and low lung function; however, it is unclear if reduced IgA levels may affect lung structure and function.\nSerum IgA, IgA1 and galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) levels were measured in the population-based Multi-Ethnic Study on Atherosclerosis (MESA). The MESA Lung Study measured percent emphysema on cardiac CT and airway dimensions on chest CT, and performed spirometry. Regression models were evaluated after adjustment for demographic and CT factors. Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses were conducted using genetic variants from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) programme. A replication analysis was performed in the SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS).\nAmong 5497 participants, lower log-normalised serum IgA levels were associated with greater percent emphysema (β=-0.084; 95% CI -0.14 to -0.026; p=0.005), which was confirmed on MR (β=-0.79; 95% CI -1.4 to -0.18; p=0.011). Greater log-normalised serum Gd-IgA1 levels were associated with airway wall thickness (β=0.0079; 95% CI 0.0017 to 0.014; p=0.012; n=2580) and decline in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (β=-0.012; 95% CI -0.021 to -0.0036; p=0.0055; n=2778) and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio (β=-0.0028; 95% CI -0.0048 to -0.00084; p=0.0054; n=2778).\nLower serum IgA levels were associated with greater percent emphysema. Additionally, higher Gd-IgA1 levels were associated with airway wall thickness and lung function decline. These findings support a protective role of IgA in emphysema pathogenesis and possible deleterious role of Gd-IgA1 in airway diseases.",
