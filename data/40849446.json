  "abstract": "Bovine tuberculosis (BTB), caused by Mycobacterium bovis, contributes significantly to human tuberculosis in developing countries, accounting for 10-15% of cases in Ethiopia. This study assessed the prevalence of BTB and associated risk factors in dairy cattle in Mekelle city and Wukro town, North Ethiopia, and evaluated farm workers' awareness of its zoonotic significance. A cross-sectional study (2020-2021) tested 240 dairy cows using comparative intradermal tuberculin skin testing and cultured 140 milk samples. BTB prevalence was 7.1% by skin test (7.5% in Mekelle, 6.3% in Wukro) and 4.1% by culture. Risk factors significantly associated with infection included large herd size, poor management, adult age, exotic breeds, and poor body condition. Only 20% of farm owners and 14% of workers were aware of BTB's zoonotic risk. These findings underscore the need for targeted public education and the implementation of control measures to reduce BTB transmission and protect public health. Without intervention, both animal productivity and human health remain at continued risk.",
