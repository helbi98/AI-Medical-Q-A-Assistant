  "title": "Physical Function and Mobility in Older Adults Receiving Treatment for Acute Myeloid Leukemia: A Longitudinal Qualitative Study.",
  "abstract": "To explore perspectives of older adults (aged 60 years or older) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) on their physical function and mobility, assessed at three time points during treatment with a hypomethylating agent and venetoclax (HMA + VEN).\nParticipants were older adults with AML (N = 17) receiving HMA + VEN at a comprehensive cancer center. Most were male and aged 64-89 years (median age = 75 years).\nThis study used a longitudinal qualitative approach with semistructured interviews at cycles 1, 2, and 7 of chemotherapy. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed using thematic analysis.\nFour themes were identified: reduced mobility and limited options for physical activities (cycle 1), periodic changes in mobility and energy level (cycle 2), acceptance and adaptation to changed mobility (cycle 7), and strategies to stay active.\nSubstantial challenges with physical function and mobility exist for older adults undergoing treatment for AML. Oncology nurses should anticipate patient needs, provide appropriate care, and make referrals to address physical and functional needs before and during HMA + VEN treatment.",
