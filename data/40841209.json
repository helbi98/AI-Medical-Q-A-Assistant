  "title": "[TRANSFORM-O: A new training program in translational research offered by the French Society of Cancer (SFC) and the French National College of Oncology Teachers (CNEC)].",
  "abstract": "Translational research, a bridge between basic and clinical research, is a key component of innovation in oncology. However, its integration into medical residency training remains poorly structured. The TRANSFORM-O program was therefore developed by the Société Française du Cancer in association with the Collège National des Enseignants en Cancérologie to introduce oncology residents to the design of clinical trials incorporating a translational research component. Sixteen oncology residents have attended this seminar through mentorship by fifteen experts from various specialties. The residents were divided into four groups according to four predefined topics: innovative biomarkers, early-phase trials, radiomics, and immunotherapy. The program took place over a weekend and included dedicated sessions for training, project development, and oral presentations. Each group designed a collaborative, fictitious clinical research project combined with an ancillary translational research component. A post-program evaluation was conducted using a Likert scale questionnaire. The overall satisfaction level with the program was high (4.80 and 4.72 out of five; residents and mentors, respectively). This initiative demonstrated both the feasibility and relevance of early exposure to translational research in oncology. It could be adapted to other medical specialties. The long-term impact of such training on residents' career paths remains to be assessed, including its broader applicability.",
