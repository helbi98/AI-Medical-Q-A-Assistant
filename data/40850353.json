  "title": "EXPLORING PULMONARY REHABILITATION PROGRAMS IMPLEMENTED AND CONDUCTED IN LATIN AMERICA FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS: A SCOPING REVIEW.",
  "abstract": "Although pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) has demonstrated efficacy in improving exercise tolerance, physical function and alleviating dyspnea in individuals with chronic respiratory conditions, there is little understanding on the delivery of PR research programs in the Latin American region.\nThis review analyzed the implementation of PR research in Latin America, adherence to established ATS criteria, and the evaluation of PR program effectiveness in the region.\nThe search was conducted in six databases (CINAHL, Medline, Embase, Scielo, Web of Science and Health and Medical Collection) to June 2025, including studies published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese. Studies with adults from Latin America participating in any PR program were included.\nWe identified 53 studies (2522 individuals) from Brazil (n=33), Colombia (n=11), Cuba (n=4), Chile (n=3), Argentina (n=1) and Uruguay (n=1). Most PR participants were individuals with COPD (87%). PR programs included exercise and educational programs involving a multidisciplinary team. Quality of life, dyspnea, aerobic capacity and muscle strength were the main assessments. Aerobic training was included in 46 studies (87%) and strength training in 38 studies (72%). Outcome measures included quality of life in 35 studies (66%), dyspnea in 45 studies (85%), aerobic capacity in 44 studies (83%) and muscle strength in 24 studies (45%). Thirty studies (57%) followed international recommendations for PR.\nIn Latin America, PR has transitioned from basic therapeutic approaches to more comprehensive, evidence-based interventions. However, disparities remain, particularly in the exercise modalities, assessments, professional team and adherence to international guidelines.",
