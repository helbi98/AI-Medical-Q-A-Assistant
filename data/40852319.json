  "title": "Evaluation of Two Online Learning Courses for Evidence-Based Trauma Treatments: TFCBT<i>Web</i>2.0 and CPT<i>Web</i>2.0.",
  "abstract": "Web courses for evidence-based treatments (EBTs) are an important component of training models and broader treatment dissemination and implementation. However, there exists limited research on the efficacy of large-scale online training, as most studies exploring these trainings focus on web courses designed for a specific research project. This project explored participation and knowledge acquisition in two large-scale web courses for trauma-focused EBTs: TFCBT<i>Web</i>2.0 and CPT<i>Web</i>2.0. Data were extracted for 174,193 TFCBT<i>Web</i>2.0 learners and 12,024 CPT<i>Web</i>2.0 learners, including learner characteristics (e.g., degree, years of experience) and knowledge acquisition from course module pre- and posttest scores. Learners demonstrated significant increases in knowledge for all TFCBT<i>Web</i>2.0 and CPT<i>Web</i>2.0 modules. Examination of completion status (i.e., started vs. completed the course) indicated that learners who identified as trainees or early career professionals were more likely to complete a web course, compared to those with terminal degrees and 5+ years of experience. Learners who registered for TFCBT<i>Web</i>2.0 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic also had slightly higher completion rates compared to peri-COVID-19 learners. Taken together, these findings suggest that web courses can be an effective tool for increasing EBT knowledge. Further, completion rates for both web courses suggest the potential importance of system-level factors (e.g., agency/supervisor support) to increase the likelihood of completing these types of trainings.",
