  "title": "A novel chitosan agarose nanocopper composite film (Cs/Agr/Cu-Cu<sub>2</sub>O NPs) using <i>Aspergillus niger</i> K Y 401431: preparation, characterization and evaluation of their antibacterial activity.",
  "abstract": "<i>Aspergillus niger</i> K Y 401431 was used in the present study for biosynthesis of copper/copper oxide nanoparticles. <i>A niger</i> K Y 401431 was checked for the production of the carcinogenic mycotoxin 'ochratoxin A' to prove the safety of the strain and the culture filtrate was free from ochratoxin A. For the optimized production of Cu/Cu<sub>2</sub>O NPs, the influence of some parameters was investigated. 10 mM of CuSO<sub>4</sub> was optimal for nanoparticle production, well-defined Cu/ Cu<sub>2</sub>O NPs formation occurred after 240 min of incubation using culture filtrate of <i>A. niger</i> K Y 401431developed under submerged culture conditions for 3 days culture age. The biosynthesized copper nanoparticles were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), X-ray diffraction (XRD). The characterization of Cu/Cu<sub>2</sub>O NPs revealed the formation of crystalline spherical shaped (Cu/Cu<sub>2</sub>O NPs) with 4-10 nm size. The cytotoxic efficacy was investigated against three cancer cell lines MCF7 (Human Caucasian breast adenocarcinoma), HEPG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line) and A549 (Lung carcinoma cell line) using MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The cytotoxic effect of the biosynthesized Cu/ Cu<sub>2</sub>O NPs on A549, HEPG-2, and MCF-7 showed IC<sub>50</sub> of 20.3, 56.9, and 43.3 µg / ml, respectively. In this study, the biosynthesized Cu/ Cu<sub>2</sub>O NPs were used for the preparation of chitosan/agarose/copper bionanocomposite film by casting method. The Cs/Agr/ Cu-Cu<sub>2</sub>O bionanocomposite films were investigated using SEM, XRD, and FT-IR. The prepared bionanocomposite film displayed enhanced antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria.",
