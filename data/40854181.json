  "title": "Digital Tools for People Without an Alzheimer Disease or Dementia Diagnosis: Scoping Review.",
  "abstract": "The field of Alzheimer disease (AD) has been moving toward earlier detection, personalized assessment of dementia risk, and dementia prevention. In the near future, a gap is expected between the growing demand for Alzheimer-related health care and a shrinking workforce. Responsibility is increasingly assigned to individuals to take an active role in their own brain health management and dementia prevention. Digital tools are thought to offer support regarding these processes.\nThe aim of this scoping review is to create an overview of digital tools published in scientific literature in the context of AD and dementia aimed at people without an AD or dementia diagnosis as primary end users interacting with these digital tools. Additionally, we aim to gain insight into study sample diversity, the stage of maturity and evaluation of these tools, and recommended future directions.\nPubMed, IEEE Xplore, Ovid, and Web of Science were searched in January 2023, using terms related to AD and dementia, (pre-)disease stages, digital tools, and various purposes of digital tools. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of 2811 records and subsequently 408 full-text articles, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles on tools targeting those with an AD or dementia diagnosis were excluded. Data extraction included information on the sample characteristics, the digital tool, stage of maturity and evaluation, and future (research) directions.\nWe included 39 articles, which were aimed at primary prevention (14/39, 36%), secondary prevention (11/39, 28%), daily life support (8/39, 21%), self-administered screening (4/39, 10%), or decision-making (2/39, 5%). Variation in the study sample emerged regarding cognitive abilities (healthy: 11/39, 28%; mild cognitive impairment: 12/39, 31%; [subjective] cognitive impairment: 9/39, 23%; \"no dementia\": 1/39, 3%; and variation of cognitive abilities: 6/39, 15%). Less variation was found regarding sex (>50% female: 27/39, 69%), education (>50% high education: 13/39, 33%), and age (>50% >60 y: 23/39, 59%). Few articles reported on ethnicity (12/39, 31%) and digital literacy (11/39, 28%). Most tools were in an early evaluation and maturity stage (31/39, 80%), comprising preprototyping (1/35, 3%), prototyping (15/35, 43%), pilot testing (19/35, 54%), efficacy testing (18/40, 45%), usability testing (12/40, 30%), and feasibility testing (10/40, 25%). Future (research) directions comprised the need for further tool development, attention to diversity, and study advancements, such as large-scale longitudinal studies.\nAlmost 80% of tools as reported on in academic literature are in early development comprising early stages of maturity and evaluation. Studies and evidence gathered for digital tools developed in the context of AD or dementia aimed at people without an AD or dementia diagnosis are thus preliminary and further development, research, and policy are required before these tools can be implemented for assessing, supporting, and preventing cognitive decline.",
