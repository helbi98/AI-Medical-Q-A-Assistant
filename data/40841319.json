  "title": "Davanat-Mimetic Galactomannan and Its Sulfated Derivative: Structure and Antitumor Effects against Melanoma.",
  "abstract": "Melanoma is the most aggressive skin cancer, with a high metastatic potential and limited treatment options in advanced stages. Polysaccharides are promising antitumor agents, and therefore, this study investigated a galactomannan from guar gum hydrolysis (GGH) and its sulfated derivative (GGHS) for their antimelanoma and immunostimulatory effects. GGH shares structural similarity with DAVANAT, a galectin-1 ligand with anticolorectal cancer activity, while GGHS has anticoagulant properties, like heparin used in cancer patients. <i>In vitro</i>, 100 Î¼g/mL GGH or GGHS inhibited melanoma cell invasion, increased adhesion, and reduced colony size, while GGHS also reduced proliferation. Both compounds bind galectin-3 and -1, but only GGH suppressed tumor progression in mice. Both treatments stimulated macrophage proinflammatory responses, including reactive oxygen species production and cytokine secretion. Although <i>in vitro</i> lymphocyte proliferation was not observed, CD3+ cells increased in the metastatic lungs. These results suggest GGH and GGHS as immunostimulatory agents, with GGH as potential melanoma adjuvant therapy.",
