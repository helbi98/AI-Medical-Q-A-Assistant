  "title": "The use of alendronate to enhance transcranial transmission of focused ultrasound for successful ablations in brain.",
  "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of alendronate therapy in improving bone density distribution in skull bones and corresponding ultrasound permeability in patients who had previously experienced unsuccessful transcranial MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) ablation. The ability of alendronate treatment to modify skull bone characteristics and enhance the success rate of repeat MRgFUS procedures was assessed.\nFive patients with initially unsuccessful MRgFUS ablations underwent a 6-12 month regimen of alendronate to improve bone density. Repeat MRgFUS procedures were performed, and changes in skull density ratio (SDR) and peak focal temperatures were evaluated statistically using CT and MR imaging. Histograms of skull bone density were introduced and analysed as an additional metric.\nAfter therapy, SDR increased in four out of five patients (from 0.378±0.037 to 0.424±0.045, p>0.05). All repeated procedures were successful. The maximum focal temperature, averaged over sonications, increased from 53.6±4.0 °C to 55.7±4.1 °C (p=0.018), while the maximum temperature per patient rose from 57.0±2.4 °C to 60.2±1.8 °C (p=0.031). Histograms of CT scans showed a reduction in low-density voxels, indicating trabecular bone densification. 3D CT scan registration revealed local density changes, defect filling, and void reduction.\nAlendronate therapy enhanced skull bone density distribution and thus ultrasound permeability, which has facilitated successful repeat MRgFUS. By visually analysing CT changes, healthcare professionals can better inform their decision-making regarding repeat surgeries. This method broadens the pool of patients with low SDR eligible for MRgFUS treatment and underscores the potential benefits of alendronate in improving treatment outcomes.",
