  "title": "The pump, the exchanger, and the Holy Spirit: tracing the 40-year evolution of the Ouabain-Na<sup>+</sup> pump endocrine system concept.",
  "abstract": "The discovery and subsequent evolution of the Ouabain-Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump endocrine system have profoundly impacted our understanding of cellular physiology and disease mechanisms. Initially identified as a cardiotonic steroid with potent effects on the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase, Ouabain has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes. The Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump, a crucial component of cellular physiology, maintains electrochemical gradients essential for nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, and cellular volume regulation. Since Jens Christian Skou's Nobel Prize-winning discovery in 1957, research has unveiled its broader role in cellular homeostasis and disease. A significant breakthrough was the identification of Ouabain as an endogenous ligand of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump, transforming the pump's role from a mere ion transporter to a receptor within a hormonal signaling pathway. This discovery has linked the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump to complex intracellular signaling pathways, with implications for hypertension, heart failure, and cancer. However, emerging evidence suggests that its role extends beyond cardiovascular dysfunction to neurological disorders such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. In epilepsy, dysregulation of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump contributes to altered ion homeostasis and hyperexcitability. At the same time, in Alzheimer's disease, its dysfunction has been associated with disrupted calcium signaling, oxidative stress, and amyloid-beta accumulation. Similarly, alterations in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump activity have been linked to dopaminergic neuron vulnerability in Parkinson's disease. This paradigm shift offers exciting therapeutic possibilities for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and depression, redefining the pump's significance across multiple disciplines of medicine.",
