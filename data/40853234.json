  "title": "Use of nanoemulsion for co-delivery of silibinin and cabazitaxel for prostate cancer treatment.",
  "abstract": "This study introduces a novel nanoemulsion (NE) system co-loaded with silibinin (SIL) and cabazitaxel (CBX) to address limitations such as poor solubility, low bioavailability, and systemic toxicities of these agents.\nSIL/CBX-loaded NE enhances the anticancer effects of SIL/CBX against prostate cancer (PCa) <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, while it could simultaneously reduce the systemic toxicity of SIL/CBX.\nThe NE-SIL/CBX was prepared using oleic acid as the oil phase, Tween-80 and Cremophor RH40 as the surfactants and Transcutol HP, as the cosurfactant.\nThe optimized NE formulation exhibited a particle size of 204.30 ± 10.20 nm, an encapsulation efficiency exceeding 95.30%, and sustained stability under biological and storage conditions. <i>In vitro</i> studies demonstrated a 6.80-fold improvement in cytotoxicity against PCa cells (IC<sub>50</sub> = 6.30 µM) compared to the free SIL/CBX combination, while maintaining 62.10% cell viability in normal cells (HEK293) at 100 µg/mL, indicating reduced off-target toxicity compared to free SIL/CBX combination. <i>In vivo</i>, NE-SIL/CBX reduced tumor volume by 78.90% and tumor weight by 80.00% while maintaining stable liver and kidney function, highlighting its safety. The formulation's controlled drug release (87.60% of drug release for SIL and 78.50% of drug release for CBX after 72 h) and synergistic therapeutic effects significantly (P ˂ 0.05) enhanced efficacy compared to free SIL and CBX.\nThese findings establish NE-SIL/CBX as a promising platform for PCa treatment, offering improved therapeutic index and reduced systemic toxicity. Future clinical investigations could validate its potential for precision oncology applications.",
