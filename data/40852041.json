  "title": "Glycosylation in kidney diseases.",
  "abstract": "Protein glycosylation is a critical post-translational modification that influences protein folding, localization, stability, and functional interactions by attaching glycans to specific sites. This process is crucial for biological functions of glycoproteins, and aberrant glycosylation can lead to genetic disorders, immune system issues, and multi-organ pathologies. Recent advancements in glycoproteomic technologies have made the study of protein glycosylation a key focus for understanding the pathogenesis of kidney diseases. This review provides a comprehensive overview of protein glycosylation mechanisms, its biological roles, molecular pathways, and significant functions in renal physiology and pathology. It specifically highlights the dynamic changes and regulatory networks associated with aberrant glycosylation in kidney diseases such as immunoglobulin A nephropathy, diabetic kidney disease, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, renal cell carcinoma, and acute kidney injury. It also evaluates the clinical applications of related technologies and biomarkers. Additionally, it discusses the challenges in developing glycosylation-targeted therapeutic strategies. Future research should focus on clarifying cell-specific glycosylation regulatory networks in the kidney, integrating glycobiology with multi-omics approaches, and improving precision diagnostics and treatment for kidney diseases.",
