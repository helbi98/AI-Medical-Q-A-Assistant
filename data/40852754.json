  "abstract": "IntroductionFor many years, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has been utilized as a chemotherapeutic treatment for a variety of malignancies. Unfortunately, 5-FU causes cardiotoxicity, which restricts its clinical use. Nifuroxazide (NFX) is a STAT-3 inhibitor with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.MethodsCardiotoxicity was induced by 5-FU (30 mg/kg) once daily for 5 days. NFX was administered in two doses, 25 and 50 mg.ResultsCompared to 5-FU-control rats, NFX significantly attenuates cardiotoxicity induced by 5-FU, as indicated by decreasing creatine kinase (CK)-MB, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) serum levels. Histopathological examinations confirmed the protective effects of NFX against histological abrasions induced by 5-FU. NFX attenuated the oxidative damage induced by 5-FU mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) signal activation. Moreover, NFX mitigated 5-FU-induced inflammation by suppressing nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 3/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (NLRP3/STAT3) signal activation. Notably, these protective effects are dose-dependent. Additionally, NFX mitigated 5-FU-induced apoptosis by downregulating Bax, while upregulating Bcl-2.ConclusionsCollectively, NFX attenuated 5-FU-induced cardiac intoxication by regulating NLRP3/STAT-3, PPAR-γ, and Bax/Bcl-2 signals.",
