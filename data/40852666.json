  "title": "Meteorological determinants of hepatitis E dynamics in Jiangsu Province, China: a pre-COVID-19 era study focusing on multi-route transmission (2005-2018).",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the impact of meteorological factors on the incidence and multi-route transmission dynamics of hepatitis E virus (HEV) in Jiangsu Province, China, during the pre-COVID-19 era (2005-2018), and to develop predictive models for informing public health interventions.\nA dual-model study integrating the Multi-Host and Multi-Route Transmission Dynamic Model (MHMRTDM) and Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was employed to quantify meteorological impacts on multi-route HEV transmission.\nHEV incidence data (2005-2018) and meteorological variables from provincial and national agencies were analyzed. The MHMRTDM quantified transmission rate coefficients (<i>β</i>, <i>β</i> <sub>w</sub> and <i>β</i> <sub>p</sub>'). GAMs linked the transmission coefficients and incidence to meteorological factors, validated using 2017-2018 data.\nThe optimal GAM integrated with the MHMRTDM was established (lowest GCV = 1.705 × 10<sup>-21</sup>, <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.980, lowest RMSE = 3.682 × 10<sup>-11</sup>, lowest MAE = 2.987 × 10<sup>-11</sup>). Analysis of four dependent variables (incidence, <i>β</i>, <i>β</i> <sub>w</sub> and <i>β</i> <sub>p</sub>') revealed distinct climate-driven patterns: (1) Incidence exhibited dual seasonal peaks linked to atmospheric pressure, sunshine duration, and humidity; (2) Host-to-person transmission (<i>β</i> <sub>p</sub>') was most sensitive to climatic conditions, peaking at 1013 hPa and declining sharply above 75% humidity, while susceptible person-to-infected person (<i>β</i>) and environment-to-person (<i>β</i> <sub>w</sub>) transmission were primarily modulated by humidity and wind speed; (3) The GAM validation confirmed robust performance for transmission coefficients (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Predictions for 2019-2021 highlighted persistent seasonal bimodality, reinforcing the model's utility for outbreak forecasting.\nMeteorological factors drive HEV transmission through distinct pathways, with host-to-person interactions being particularly climate-sensitive. While the GAM provided valuable insights, future research incorporating behavioral and land-use factors, as well as causal inference models, will be critical for improving the understanding and predictive accuracy of HEV transmission dynamics.",
