  "title": "Effects of Velagliflozin in 8 Cats With Diabetes Mellitus and Hypersomatotropism.",
  "abstract": "Velagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor licensed for the treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM) in cats, but its use in cats with hypersomatotropism is not described.\nTo describe the use of velagliflozin in cats with DM and hypersomatotropism.\nEight client-owned cats with DM and hypersomatotropism treated with velagliflozin.\nRetrospective multicentric case series. Clinical data, including diabetic clinical score, insulin dose, and continuous glucose monitoring-derived metrics were compared between the last follow-up before velagliflozin introduction (T0) and the first (T1) and last (T2) follow-ups after velagliflozin introduction.\nDiabetic clinical score improved in 6/8 cats after velagliflozin initiation. Median daily insulin dose decreased from 1.9 U/kg (range 0.8-7.1) at T0 to 0.5 U/kg (0-2.3) at T1 (median difference [MD] = -1.2 U/kg; 95% CI: -5.2 to 0.5; p = 0.02). Mean glucose was lower both at T1 (207 mg/dL, 96-326) and T2 (273 mg/dL, 155-350) than at T0 (435 mg/dL, 298-477; MD = -177 mg/dL, 95% CI: -238 to -92, p = 0.008 and MD = -113 mg/dL, 95% CI: -280 to -18, p = 0.03, respectively). Percentage of time in range was higher at T1 (71%, 21-98) and T2 (41%, 14-100) than at T0 (3%, 0-32; MD = 61%, 95% CI: 21 to 80, p = 0.008 and MD = 34%, 95% CI: 2 to 98, p = 0.03, respectively). Velagliflozin allowed for insulin discontinuation in two cats. One cat developed diabetic ketoacidosis on day 143, and one cat had acute kidney injury.\nVelagliflozin improved diabetic control in cats with DM and hypersomatotropism, either in combination with insulin or as monotherapy.",
