  "title": "Movement disorders rounds: Neurophysiological findings in abdominal movements in CASPR2 encephalitis.",
  "abstract": "Abdominal movements have been described as a possible unique manifestation of CASPR2-related autoimmune encephalitis. We describe a case of abdominal movements with neurophysiological evaluation showing a mean EMG burst duration of 350 ms and frequency of 1 Hz compatible with myorrhythmia. The case illustrates that awareness of the unique presentations of CASPR2-related autoimmune encephalitis can allow for timely diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment.",
