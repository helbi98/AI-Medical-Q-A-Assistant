  "abstract": "Spinal Intramedullary tuberculoma is a rare occurrence constituting about 0.2% to 0.5% of all central nervous system tuberculomas. It is considered rare even in tuberculosis endemic areas. Mostly affecting young individuals, it is mostly found in thoracic cord. The occurrence of intramedullary tuberculoma in the conus medullaris is even rare. We present a case of a 41-year-old female who presented with symptoms of sudden loss of bowel and bladder function along with saddle anesthesia which later on imaging and biopsy findings was diagnosed to be case of intramedullary tuberculoma of conus medullaris, and was managed with anti-tubercular regimen and corticosteroids.",
