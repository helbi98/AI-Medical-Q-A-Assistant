  "abstract": "The goal of this study was to identify lung cancer biomarkers specific for African Americans (AA) by conducting a genome-wide analysis and understand the role of these biomarkers in overall survival.\nAll cancer studied by the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were queried with TCGAbiolinks R package (RRID:SCR_017683) for mRNA expression, DNA methylation, and clinical data. Differential expression analysis was performed comparing mRNA expression between AA and Caucasians. Survival duration differences were studied using two-tailed log-rank test. Association with survival was quantified using hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals with univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. Spearman's rank correlation analysis was used to identify CpG sites correlated with mRNA expression.\nCEACAM7 was the only gene overexpressed among AA comparing to Caucasians with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and its RNA expression was significantly associated with cancer stage, overall survival duration and mortality risk in AA. DNA methylation on CpG probes cg22895231, cg25465322, cg01656853, cg17659920, and cg07940585 were negatively correlated with CEACAM7 mRNA expression, directly associated with survival duration, and inversely associated with mortality risk in AA with LUAD. Median survival was 37.29 months vs not reached for the high vs low CEACAM7 expression groups. The 1-, 2- and 5-year survival rates for the high vs low CEACAM7 mRNA expression were 80% vs 100%, 50% vs 100%, and 20% vs 86%, respectively.\nCEACAM7 mRNA expression and its DNA methylation may be associated with overall survival duration and mortality risk among AA with LUAD but not in Caucasians.",
