  "title": "Shortwave infrared imaging increases the number of lymph nodes and improves cancer staging: a 104-patient study.",
  "abstract": "Adequate lymph node examination is key to accurate cancer staging. This study investigates the effectiveness of shortwave infrared imaging in increasing the overall and positive lymph node numbers.\nSpecimens from various anatomic sites, including colorectal, pancreatic, breast, gastric, skin and small bowel resections, were evaluated. 104 specimens were first grossed with manual palpation and then grossed with the assistance of shortwave infrared imaging. The overall and positive lymph node numbers were documented.\nIn 90 of the 104 cases (86.5%), shortwave infrared imaging helped identify additional lymph nodes. On average, 4.81 additional lymph nodes were found. In 11 of the 104 cases (10.6%), additional positive lymph nodes were found. In 4 of the 104 cases (3.8%), cancer stages were changed.\nShortwave infrared imaging may increase the number of lymph nodes identified and has the potential to improve cancer staging accuracy. Further validation in larger, randomised or prospective studies is warranted.",
