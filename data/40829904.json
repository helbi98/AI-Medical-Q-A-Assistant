  "abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the epidemiological characteristics and spatiotemporal distribution of hepatitis C in Henan province from 2012 to 2022. <b>Methods:</b> The case report data on hepatitis C from counties and districts in Henan between 2012 and 2022 were collected. The distribution characteristics were analyzed by descriptive epidemiological methods, and GeoDa1.2 software was used to perform spatial autocorrelation analysis. The spatiotemporal epidemiological analysis was conducted using SaTScan 10.1 software. <b>Results:</b> A total of 274 485 hepatitis C cases were reported in Henan from 2012 to 2022. The reported annual average incidence rate was 25.84/100 000 and showed an overall downward trend from 2012 to 2022 (<i>Z</i>=-4.05, <i>P</i><0.001). More cases were reported in women. The cases were mainly aged 40-69 years and farmers. Spatial autocorrelation analysis showed that the reported cases of hepatitis C present spatial clustering during 2012-2022, and the areas with high incidence were mainly distributed in counties or districts of Zhengzhou, Zhumadian, Xuchang, Zhoukou, and Nanyang. One class I clustering area was detected by spatiotemporal scanning, which mainly covered Xuchang, Pingdingshan and the surrounding counties (<i>LLR</i>=16 117.73, <i>RR</i>=1.81, <i>P</i><0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> The reported cases of hepatitis C in Henan Province show an overall downward trend from 2012 to 2022 and present spatiotemporal clustering. The seasonal regularity of the hepatitis C epidemic is not obvious. People aged 40-69 years old and farmers are the key population for prevention and control.",
