  "title": "Prevalence and risk factors of heavy menstrual bleeding in Africa: a narrative review.",
  "abstract": "Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is a common and impactful reproductive health issue that affects women worldwide, with significant implications for physical, emotional, and social well-being. In Africa, the prevalence of HMB is underreported, with estimates ranging from 10% to 30% in different regions. Factors such as limited access to healthcare, socioeconomic disparities, and cultural beliefs contribute to the high burden of HMB among African women. Despite the increasing recognition of its impact, substantial gaps remain in research and healthcare resources to address the condition comprehensively across the continent. Several risk factors contribute to the prevalence of HMB in African women, including chronic diseases like anemia, diabetes, and HIV, as well as reproductive health disorders such as fibroids and endometrial abnormalities. Nutritional deficiencies, particularly iron deficiency anemia, are widespread in many African populations, exacerbating the risk of excessive bleeding. Additionally, socio-cultural practices, including stigma and taboos surrounding menstruation, prevent timely diagnosis and treatment, further complicating management efforts.",
