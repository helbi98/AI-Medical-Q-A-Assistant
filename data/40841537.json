  "abstract": "Millions of people worldwide suffer from Parkinson's disease (PD), which has a varying distribution and features in each country. Since there is a shortage of data regarding PD patients in Iran, we present a registry-based study to deepen our understanding of Iranian PD patients' characteristics, distribution, and clinical differences between genders and different ages of onset. In six years, 4048 patients were interviewed, who had a mean age of 67.66 years, and consisted of 1474 (36.4%) females and 2571 (63.5%) males. Men suffered more from apathy, speech, handwriting, and salivation, while women experienced more anxiety, depression, pain, and psychosis, after multivariable regression. Early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) and late-onset Parkinson's disease (LOPD) were divided based on the 50-year-old cut-off age. They were represented by 989 (24.6%) and 2834 (70%) of the total, respectively, and EOPD patients had a higher duration of the disease and a higher positive family history.",
