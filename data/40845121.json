  "abstract": "People with HIV (PWH) are at an increased risk for cognitive impairment. Lifestyle factors can have protective effects on cognition; little work has examined diet and cognitive function in PWH. In this cross-sectional pilot study, 86 PWH (mean age 56 years) completed diet recalls and a neurocognitive assessment. Correlations were conducted between diet and cognitive function, adjusting for total calories, sex, and education (multiple comparison correction p values are reported). Diet quality of the sample was poor. Greater calories per day (r = 0.28, p =.08) and greater percentage of calories from saturated fatty acids (SFAs; r = 0.26, p = 0.08) were associated with better cognition. Higher intake of SFAs (rs 0.30-0.31, ps = 0.07), amino acids (rs = 0.27, ps = 0.08), and phosphorus (r = 0.29, p = .07) and magnesium (r = 0.25, p = .08) were associated with better cognition. A diet reflecting higher protein and fat relative to carbohydrates was associated with better cognition. Targeting individual nutrients, improving diet quality, and adequate caloric intake may preserve cognition in PWH.",
