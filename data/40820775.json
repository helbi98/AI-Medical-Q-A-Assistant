  "title": "Using Peer Outreach to Identify Hepatitis C Infections Among Clients of a Syringe Service Program.",
  "abstract": "To increase testing for hepatitis C among people who inject drugs, a syringe service program (SSP) in the northeastern United States trained peer workers to offer testing at van-based clinics. Peer workers approached SSP clients from August 2019 through March 2020 and from June 2021 through March 2022 to discuss hepatitis C and offer rapid onsite hepatitis C antibody testing. Of 573 clients approached, 28 (5%) consented to testing. Reasons for refusal included: 1) already tested, 2) not enough time, and 3) not worried about hepatitis. Of 28 tested, 9 (32%) were positive for hepatitis C antibodies. Adjustments to peer-worker testing strategy may be needed to increase acceptance of testing in this high-risk population.",
