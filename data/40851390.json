  "abstract": "Accurate classification of <i>Breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA)1/2</i> variants is important to delineate candidates for surgical or medical treatment. We retrospectively analyzed <i>BRCA1/BRCA2</i> sequencing data and reclassified the <i>BRCA1/2</i> variants of unknown significance (VUS) in Turkish patients with breast, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancers.\n<i>BRCA1/BRCA2</i> sequence data of a large cohort were retrospectively analyzed. The sequencing data were reinterpreted in the context of American College of Medical Genetics guidelines, the Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles <i>BRCA1/2</i> classification rules, and current public genomic databases.\nAmong the total of 2,713 patients, 254 (9.36%) had <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> variants. A total of 264 <i>BRCA1/BRCA2</i> variants were detected. Of these, 130 (49.2%) were pathogenic variants (PV), 24 (9%) were likely pathogenic (LP) and 110 of 264 variants (41.6%) were VUS. For the 119 <i>BRCA1</i> variants, 68% (<i>n</i> = 81) were PV, 7.5% (<i>n</i> = 9) were LP, and 24.5% (<i>n</i> = 29) were VUS. Similarly, for the 145 <i>BRCA2</i> variants, 33.7% (<i>n</i> = 49) were PV, 10.3% (<i>n</i> = 15) were LP, and 55.8% (<i>n</i> = 81) were VUS. Reanalysis of the 110 <i>BRCA1+BRCA2</i> VUS variants led to 22 (20%) being reclassified. Of these 22, 45.4% (<i>n</i> = 10) were reclassified as P/LP and 54.6% (<i>n</i> = 12) were reclassified as benign/likely benign.\nThese results show that it may be possible to reclassify VUS, in this case <i>BRCA1/2</i> VUS, in light of changing genetic data. These results demonstrate the importance of VUS reclassification of <i>BRCA1/2</i> variants in clinical management, surgical decisions, risk counseling and screening.",
