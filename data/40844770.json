  "abstract": "Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people have significantly higher rates of cardiovascular-related conditions than cisgender people, and Black and Hispanic people have higher rates of cardiovascular-related conditions than non-Hispanic White people. However, little is known about the prevalence of cardiovascular-related conditions among racial and ethnic subgroups of TGD people.\nTo compare the prevalence of cardiovascular-related conditions across racial and ethnic groups for TGD and cisgender people using quantitative intersectional methods.\nMedicare enrollment and claims data were used from TGD and cisgender beneficiaries from 2011 to 2020. Using an established algorithm, likely TGD people were identified based on their diagnosis codes and care utilization. The 10 nearest-neighbor cisgender matches for each TGD beneficiary were identified based on propensity scores estimated from the original basis of eligibility, years of enrollment, age, and hospital service area.\nRace, ethnicity, and gender modality (TGD and cisgender). These data were analyzed from November 7, 2023, to October 31, 2024.\nRate of cardiovascular-related conditions (peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) among Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic TGD beneficiaries compared with non-Hispanic White cisgender counterparts using generalized estimating equations, cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors. Attributable proportions for TGD Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic beneficiaries were calculated.\nOf the 36 004 TGD beneficiaries, 714 Asian and Pacific Islander (2%), 4518 Black (13%), and Hispanic 2545 (7%) had higher rates of cardiovascular-related conditions than 28 227 non-Hispanic White (78%) beneficiaries and higher than the 323 613 cisgender beneficiaries (5981 Asian and Pacific Islander [2%]; 40 781 Black [13%]; 22 417 Hispanic [7%]; 254 434 White [79%]). Black TGD beneficiaries had a 74% higher prevalence of peripheral vascular disease, 76% higher prevalence of congestive heart failure, and 50% higher prevalence of diabetes than similar non-Hispanic White cisgender beneficiaries. Overall, 6.3% of the excess peripheral vascular disease among Black TGD beneficiaries and 19.9% of the excess peripheral vascular disease among Asian and Pacific Islander TGD beneficiaries were associated with being at the intersection of gender, race, and ethnicity.\nThis cross-sectional study found that Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic TGD beneficiaries had a high prevalence of cardiovascular-related conditions and had an elevated prevalence of several conditions, attributable to the intersection of gender, race, and ethnicity. Medicare should use the tools at its disposal to support the health of TGD beneficiaries.",
