  "title": "Hypertension: a cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging update.",
  "abstract": "The underlying aetiology and pathophysiology of arterial hypertension often remain unclear. To provide a better understanding of the disease process, a more comprehensive and multisystem use of magnetic resonance imaging is advocated in the assessment of hypertensive patients, with additional novel focus on the 'selfish brain hypothesis'. This approach may guide more individualised therapy to managing one of the most important noncommunicable causes of human morbidity and mortality.",
