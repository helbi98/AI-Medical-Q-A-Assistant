  "title": "Ticagrelor Paradox: Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.",
  "abstract": "Based on the landmark PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) and TRITON-TIMI 38 (Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition With Prasugrel-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) trials, current guidelines recommend ticagrelor and prasugrel over clopidogrel for acute coronary syndrome. However, subsequent studies have failed to replicate the reported benefits of ticagrelor, raising concerns about the validity of the PLATO trial's findings.\nRandomized trials published until January 2025 were searched on PubMed and Embase and included if they compared 2 of the 3 standard dual antiplatelet therapies: 12 months aspirin plus clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor. We constructed a network with and without PLATO to assess its impact on the synthesized risk estimates on major adverse cardiovascular events, patient mortality, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis, as well as major bleeding and major or minor bleeding.\nTwelve trials, enrolling 52 415 patients (clopidogrel: 23 557; ticagrelor: 13 344, prasugrel: 15 514) were included. The analysis with PLATO showed lower hazard ratios for ticagrelor versus clopidogrel than the analysis without PLATO in major adverse cardiovascular events, mortality, myocardial infarction, and bleeding outcomes (e.g., cardiovascular mortality; hazard ratio [HR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.72-0.96] when PLATO was included; HR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.73-1.25] when PLATO was excluded). Ticagrelor and prasugrel were associated with higher incidences of major bleeding and major or minor bleeding for analyses including and excluding PLATO, altohugh the point estimates for ticagrelor were lower when PLATO was included.\nThe pooled estimates with PLATO favored ticagrelor compared with estimates without PLATO in several studied outcomes, potentially suggesting the substantial impacts of PLATO's findings on the pooled risk estimates; therefore, additional evidence may be needed given the large number of patients worldwide treated with dual antiplatelet therapy.",
