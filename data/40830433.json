  "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are infectious diseases that pose serious threats to human health. TB and HIV can interact to promote the progression of diseases. This study aims to provide basic evidence for the formulation of disease prevention and control strategies.\nA retrospective study was conducted to analyze the characteristics of demographics and comorbidity, in an attempt to identify factors associated with HIV and TB coinfection among TB inpatients at Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu, China from January 2018 to December 2022.\nAmong 37,587 TB inpatients, HIV-positive and HIV-negative TB cases accounted for 6.1% (2,301) and 93.9% (35,286), respectively.11.9% (4,468) were extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB), of which 6.2%(278) were HIV-positive EPTB. Among TB, the most common types of HIV-positive TB were pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) (87.9% [2,023]), tuberculous pleurisy (34.4% [791]), and lymph node tuberculosis (33.1% [762]). The proportion of HIV-positive TB decreased from 7.0% in 2018 to 5.1% in 2022 (<i>P</i> < 0.001), showing a downward trend. Factors associated with HIV-positive TB included being 18–59 years of age, male sex, divorced or widowed status, and urban residence. The comorbidity factors associated with HIV-positive TB included hepatitis C infection and syphilis. Those with HIV-positive TB were more likely to be complicated with opportunistic infections, including cryptococcal infection, toxoplasma infection, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PjP).\nEarly screening for HIV in TB with associated factors, comprehensive management, and control of comorbidities may significantly contribute to achieving the WHO End TB Strategy targets.",
