  "abstract": "Small non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST) is involved in AD, though its regulation remains unclear.\nWe performed real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in autopsied brain tissues to determine miR-153-3p and AD associations. A reporter-based assay measured the activity of REST mRNA 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived neurons and human cell lines were applied to determine miR-153-3p regulation of endogenous proteins.\nElevation of miR-153-3p is associated with a reduced probability of AD, while elevated REST is associated with a greater probability of AD. The 3'-UTR functional assay pinpointed the miR-153-3p binding sites. miR-153-3p treatment reduced REST, amyloid precursor protein (APP), and α-synuclein (SNCA) 3'-UTR activities and protein levels. miR-153-3p treatment altered REST and neuronal differentiation in iPSC-derived neuronal stem cells. RNA-sequencing and proteomics revealed miR-153-3p-associated networks.\nmiR-153-3p reduces REST, APP, and SNCA expression, pointing toward its therapeutic and biomarker potential in neurodegenerative diseases.\nWith the increased emphasis on comorbidities of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases, we identified that miR-153-3p, as a master regulator, reduced a group of neurodegeneration related proteins: REST, amyloid precursor protein (APP) and α-synuclein (SNCA) levels. The elevation of miR-153-3p levels is associated with reduced probability of AD in posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), while REST, by contrast, is associated with a greater probability of AD. miR-153-3p treatment alters REST protein levels and neuronal differentiation in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived neuronal cells. RNA sequencing proteomics and interactome analysis revealed the role of miR-153-3p in axonal guidance.",
