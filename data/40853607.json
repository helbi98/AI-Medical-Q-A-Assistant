  "title": "The roles of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the function of leukemic stem cells (LSCs): a comprehensive review.",
  "abstract": "All forms of leukemia, including AML, ALL, CML, and CLL, are estimated to make up 2.5% of new cancer diagnoses and 3.1% of all cancer fatalities worldwide. Leukemia is mainly propelled by LSCs that possess remarkable self-renewal and differentiation abilities, comparable to those of regular HSCs. The presence of LSCs is crucial for the progress and amplification of leukemia, as they enable evasion of the immune system and resilience to therapy. ncRNAs have emerged as a potential means of regulating various forms of cancer, owing to their role in diverse cellular processes. Long non-coding RNAs, microRNAs, and Circular RNAs are among the most studied ncRNAs and exert control over the expression of numerous proteins related to the advancement of malignancies. Given the importance of LSCs in leukemia and the potential of ncRNAs, we aimed to explore the ncRNAs abnormally expressed in leukemia and investigate them as therapeutic targets. In addition, in our review, we thoroughly examined the ncRNAs responsible for conferring chemo-resistance to LSCs.",
