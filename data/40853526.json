  "title": "Kicking Off Motherhood: Considering Return to Play Postpartum in the Footballer.",
  "abstract": "The longstanding belief that pregnancy marks the end of a footballer's career is increasingly being challenged, with more players returning to professional, domestic, and international competition after childbirth. Pregnancy and childbirth involve unique physiological, musculoskeletal, and psychological adaptations that can influence postpartum health, wellbeing, and the return-to-play (RTP) process. This narrative review synthesizes current literature on postpartum RTP, with a focus on the specific needs of footballers. Key considerations include labor and delivery, postpartum health and wellbeing, general postpartum physical activity guidelines, broader return-to-sport principles, and football-specific factors. By supporting footballers to continue their careers through motherhood, we can enhance player retention and inspire future generations to engage in football across the lifespan.",
