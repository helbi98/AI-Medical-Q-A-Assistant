  "abstract": "This study evaluates the effects of combined psychological intervention and enhanced nutritional support on postoperative recovery in CRC patients, focusing on nutritional status, sleep quality, pain management, psychological well-being, and quality of life.\nA randomized controlled trial was conducted at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from August 2021 to August 2023. A total of 300 CRC patients who underwent surgery were randomly assigned to the observation group (150 patients), receiving standard postoperative care plus psychological intervention and enhanced nutritional support, or the control group (150 patients), receiving standard care only. Primary outcomes included nutritional status (weight, serum albumin, total protein), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), pain (Visual Analog Scale), psychological status (Self-Rating Anxiety and Depression Scales), and quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30).\nThe observation group showed significant improvements in nutritional status, with higher serum albumin, total protein, prealbumin, and transferrin, along with increased body weight (P < 0.05). Sleep quality improved, with significantly lower PSQI scores (P < 0.05). Pain management was more effective, reflected by lower VAS scores (P < 0.05). Psychological assessments revealed reduced anxiety and depression, with lower SAS and SDS scores (P < 0.05). The observation group also had higher EORTC QLQ-C30 scores, indicating better quality of life (P < 0.05).\nPsychological intervention combined with enhanced nutritional support significantly improves postoperative recovery in CRC patients by enhancing nutritional status, sleep quality, pain management, and psychological well-being. This integrated approach may serve as an effective strategy for CRC rehabilitation.\nIntegrating psychological support with enhanced nutritional care significantly improves recovery, quality of life, and emotional wellbeing after colorectal cancer surgery. For survivors, this highlights the importance of comprehensive supportive interventions that address both physical and psychological needs in routine survivorship care.",
