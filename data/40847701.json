  "title": "A Multilevel Partnership Approach to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening.",
  "abstract": "The District of Columbia Department of Health (DC Health) has been a recipient of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Colorectal Cancer Control Program funding since 2015. We present details on the partnership model established by DC Health to increase screening uptake among populations with low levels of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. We examined the DC Health partnership model using a mixed-methods case study approach. DC Health's CRC screening program uses a socioecological framework approach, focusing on the individual, interpersonal, organization, and community levels, to work with partners to increase CRC screening by implementing evidence-based interventions. We present details on the role of each partner, their socioecological model of influence, and key responsibilities. The DC Health partnership supported implementation of evidence-based interventions and CRC screening in nine health systems that serve patient populations with high CRC risk factors and historically low CRC screening trends. CRC screening uptake among health system partners increased from 19% in 2015 to 53% by 2022, surpassing the average screening rate in DC's Federally Qualified Health Centers (47%). The DC Health experience illustrates how multi-level partnerships can contribute to increasing CRC screening.",
