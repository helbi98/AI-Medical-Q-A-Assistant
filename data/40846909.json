  "abstract": "Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) may experience better health outcomes when they engage in physical activity (PA). The aim of the study was to assess the physical activity level of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and its potentials risk factor for health.\nA cross-sectional study was carried out at Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Mymensingh, Bangladesh from October 2023 to January 2024. A total of 253 CKD patients aged 18 years and older at moderate to advanced stages were enrolled in the study. The global physical activity questionnaire (GPAQ) was used to measure the physical activity for health of CKD patients. Physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores were measured by Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) questionnaire. Socio-demographic and medical records were also collected. Both logistic regression and descriptive statistics were used for data.\nOf 253 participants (62.8% male, mean age 60.1 years), 41.1% did not meet PA recommendations. Median PA durations were 28.57 min/day for moderate PA (MPA), 8.57 min/day for transport, and 11.43 min/day for recreation. Poor physical function (PCS ≤ 41.04) was observed in 85.8% of participants, and 51.0% had depressive disorders (MCS ≤ 45.6). Logistic regression identified younger age [adjusted OR (AOR) 3.29], moderate stage of CKD (AOR 2.39), good physical function (AOR 3.01), absence of depression (AOR 4.87), and family history of CKD (AOR 2.65) were significant predictors of meeting PA recommendations (p < 0.05).\nA substantial proportion of Bangladeshi CKD patients do not meet PA recommendations, with younger age, moderate CKD, better physical function, absence of depression, and family history of CKD predicting higher PA engagement. Targeted interventions addressing these factors, particularly early in CKD progression, are needed to promote PA and improve health outcomes in this population.\nNot applicable.",
