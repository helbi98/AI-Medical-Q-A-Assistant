  "abstract": "Liver cancer is the fourth most deadly cancer, and early detection and timely treatment apparently play a crucial role in it. Intestinal bacteria affect the development of liver cancer through various pathways. In this study, the gut bacteria of liver cancer patients are analysed in detail by using metagenomic sequencing technology, and some of the bacterial species and metabolic pathways that may affect the development of liver cancer have been identified. Additionally, we identified bacterial factors that may impact key clinical indicators of the tumour. The findings of this study provide a scientific foundation for understanding the mechanisms underlying liver cancer development. This study freshened insights into clinical treatment strategies for liver cancer.",
