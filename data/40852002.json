  "abstract": "Contradictory data exists regarding COVID-19's impact on pregnancy outcomes. This study will compare pandemic pregnancy outcomes to pre-pandemic levels in local, regional, and national populations.\nWe searched three international electronic databases (PubMed) for research on COVID-19 infection and pregnancy outcomes from the first accessible to 10 December 2021. We included articles on COVID-19's effects on pregnancy, maternal, and neonatal outcomes, using pregnancy as the main endpoint.\nTwenty-eight studies were examined. The exposed population sampled 1 476 827, and the total sample was 23 819 822. One-third of studies found a pandemic-related increase in maternal mortality. Six of fourteen stillbirth studies showed a substantial increase. Ten of fourteen studies found no substantial increase in preterm birth rates. After the pandemic, postnatal depression, maternal anxiety, or both increased in five of nine mother mental health studies.\nThere is a significant increase in postnatal maternal mental disorders and a probable increase in maternal mortality and stillbirth compared to before the pandemic. However, our study's findings might result from healthcare inefficiency. COVID-19 vaccination is highly recommended for pregnant and breastfeeding women.",
