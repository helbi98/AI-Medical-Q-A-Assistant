  "title": "Partial Diaphragm Division is Associated with Decreased Ventilator Support after Open Thoracoabdominal Aortic Repair.",
  "abstract": "The most frequent complications of open thoracoabdominal aortic repair are respiratory in nature. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of intraoperative diaphragm management on prolonged postoperative ventilation, pulmonary complications, and overall outcomes in patients undergoing open thoracoabdominal aortic repair.\nRetrospective single-institutional review of patients who underwent extent I-V open thoracoabdominal aortic repair between 2013 and 2024. Patients who did not require diaphragm division were excluded. Outcomes were analyzed in two groups based on complete or partial diaphragm division. The primary outcome was prolonged ventilation, defined as postoperative ventilator support >48 hours. Secondary outcomes included early respiratory morbidity, in-hospital mortality, major adverse events, intensive care unit and hospital stay. Univariate followed by multivariable analysis was used to evaluate the association of extent of diaphragm division with the primary and secondary outcomes.\nAmong 135 patients who underwent open thoracoabdominal aortic repair during the study period, 110 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Average age was 54 Â±14 years, and 77 patients (70%) were male. Most repairs were done for post-dissection aneurysms (n=83, 76%) requiring extent II thoracoabdominal aortic repair (n=88, 80%). Demographics, comorbidities, and preoperative variables were similar between the two groups. Full circumferential diaphragm division was performed in 60 patients (54%), while 50 patients (46%) had partial division. Prolonged ventilation occurred in twenty-five patients (24%). On univariate analysis, patients who underwent full circumferential diaphragm division were more likely to have prolonged ventilation as compared to those who had partial division (32%, n=18 vs 15%, n=7, p=0.037). This association persisted on multivariable analysis (odds ratio; 4.0, CI; 1.4-11.8, p=0.01). Patients who had full circumferential diaphragm division demonstrated a trend towards higher rate of postoperative pneumonia (35% vs 25%), need for re-intubation (16% vs 8%), and intensive care unit readmission (20% vs 10%). No significant difference was seen when comparing in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit and hospital stay, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, and renal failure requiring dialysis.\nPartial division of the diaphragm is associated with shorter duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation but without any significant impact on mortality or major adverse events. Partial diaphragm division should be considered in open thoracoabdominal aortic repair repairs.",
