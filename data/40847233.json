  "title": "Novel Immune Modulatory Agents in the Treatment of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.",
  "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) makes up the large majority of lung cancer diagnoses. After the discovery of immune modulators or immunotherapy, treatments that could utilize the patient's own immune system to target malignant cells, the landscape of lung cancer treatment, NSCLC in particular, has greatly evolved with vast improvements in outcomes and survival. Currently, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have had the greatest impact on the current treatment of non-driver mutated non-small cell lung cancer. Unfortunately, resistance to treatment whether primary or secondary, remains a concern. To overcome resistance, investigators have sought combination immune modulator treatments and have even identified novel agents to utilize, including adoptive cellular therapies, antibody-drug conjugates, and vaccines. Some of these agents have been more successful than others with combination strategies currently leading the way but there are some limitations. Other agents are early in development and will need to await further data before determining the impact on lung cancer treatment. Immunotherapy or immune modulatory agents remain an essential aspect of NSCLC treatment and continue to be the subject of novel research and development.",
