  "title": "Pulmonary plasma cell disorders: histopathology, diagnosis, and clinical perspectives.",
  "abstract": "Plasma cell disorders in the lungs include a broad range of conditions from benign reactive processes to malignant neoplasms. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of these diseases, focusing on their histopathological, immunohistochemical, and diagnostic characteristics. Four case studies illustrate the diagnostic challenges in distinguishing between reactive plasma cell infiltrates and neoplastic conditions. Key diagnostic tools, such as histological analysis and molecular techniques, are discussed to guide clinical evaluation. A systematic approach to diagnosis and management is mandatory for treatment decisions. Understanding the full spectrum of plasma cell abnormalities in the lung enables clinicians and pathologists to achieve accurate diagnoses and improve patient outcomes.",
