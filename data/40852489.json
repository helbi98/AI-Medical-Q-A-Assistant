  "title": "Association between Trust of Researchers and Willingness to Participate in Alzheimer's Disease Biomarker Research.",
  "abstract": "The study examined the relationship between trust of researchers in research na√Øve participants, including those at higher risk, and interest in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) biomarker research participation.\nA cohort of 399 community-dwelling older adults completed a survey about their trust of researchers and interest in participating in ADRD biomarker research.\nAfter controlling for sociodemographics and knowledge of ADRD, higher trust of researchers was associated with lower levels of hesitancy to participate in ADRD biomarker and neuroimaging studies (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Higher trust of researchers was associated with agreement with research-related motivation statements and interest in return of results from neuroimaging and memory tests (<i>p</i> < 0.05).\nOur findings show that trust of researchers is highly correlated with research participation, independent of knowledge of ADRD and sociodemographics, and should be a focus to accelerate ADRD biomarker research participation, such as groups at higher risk.",
