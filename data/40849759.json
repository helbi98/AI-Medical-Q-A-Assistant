  "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and hallmark pathological features, such as amyloid-beta plaques and tau protein tangles. Despite substantial research, current therapeutic strategies remain primarily symptomatic, with limited success in preventing or reversing disease progression. One major challenge is the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), which restricts the delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain. Nanotechnology provides innovative solutions to these challenges by enabling the development of targeted drug delivery systems tailored to AD's unique pathophysiology. Nanoparticles offer several advantages for AD therapy, including their small size, surface modifiability, and the ability to traverse the BBB. These carriers can enhance drug stability, prolong systemic circulation, and enable controlled drug release, reducing systemic toxicity while maximizing therapeutic efficacy. Among various approaches, nanoparticles functionalized with ligands targeting AD show promise in promoting the clearance of pathological aggregates, potentially slowing disease progression and alleviating neurotoxicity. Liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, and exosomes are notable nanocarriers that have been successfully engineered to deliver a range of therapeutic agents, including anti-amyloid drugs, neuroprotective compounds, and gene therapies. Recent advancements also emphasize stimulus-responsive nanocarriers that release drugs in response to specific pathological cues, further enhancing treatment precision. This article delves into the most recent advancements in nanotechnology for AD therapy, and the potential of these innovative systems to overcome long-standing barriers in AD treatment and paving the way for more effective and targeted interventions.",
