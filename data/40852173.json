  "title": "Anxiety Symptom Severity and Implicit and Explicit Self-As-Anxious Associations in a Large Online Sample of U.S. Adults: Trends From 2011 to 2022.",
  "abstract": "Some studies suggest a rise in anxiety prevalence and severity over the past decade, particularly among emerging adults, while others report stable rates. This preregistered study examines trends in anxiety symptom severity and explicit (self-reported) and implicit (using the Brief Implicit Association Test) associations about the self as anxious vs. calm. Using continuous cross-sectional data from 99,973 U.S. adults who visited the Project Implicit Health website between 2011-2022, we compared trends in anxiety outcomes between emerging adults (age 18-25) and adults age 26+, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Contrary to hypotheses, average anxiety severity and strength of implicit/explicit self-as-anxious associations did not spike at the start of the pandemic, and rates of change did not significantly differ by age from 2011-2020, except for explicit, non-relative self-as-anxious ratings. Instead, anxiety mostly remained stable, with emerging adults exhibiting consistently higher anxiety symptom severity and stronger implicit/explicit self-as-anxious associations than adults age 26+.",
