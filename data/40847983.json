  "title": "A Rare Case of Cerebral Infarct Leading to Acute Heart Failure With a 4-Year Follow-Up.",
  "abstract": "It is not uncommon for ischaemic heart conditions to cause cerebral infarcts. However, what is rarely seen is a cerebral infarct leading to heart failure. This case report describes a 42-year-old male admitted with acute onset symptoms in keeping with a posterior circulation infarct, who later deteriorated during admission as a result of left ventricular heart failure. At the 18-month follow-up, the patient's overall condition had improved due to management for the cerebral infarct and the heart failure which restored the patient's heart function. The patient remained symptom-free throughout the follow-ups across 4 years. Due to the lack of pre-existing heart conditions in this patient, the most plausible cause of their heart failure was as a result of the reduced blood supply to the lateral medulla. This phenomenon has been rarely commented on thus far and warrants further discussion around its pathophysiological mechanisms and management.",
