  "title": "Quality of life and life satisfaction in long-term survivors of acute myeloid leukemia.",
  "abstract": "We performed a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study to analyze Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) long-term survivor (LTS) outcomes, including psychosocial well-being and somatic health status. Four-hundred-twenty-seven former AML patients participated (response rate, 63%) ≥5 years[y] and up to 18.6 y past their leukemia diagnosis (median, 11.3 y). Median age at study participation was 61 y (range 28y-93y), 23% had experienced disease relapse, and 63% had received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). Overall, quality of life (QoL) and general life satisfaction (gLS) summary scores were higher in AML LTS (p < 0.001) compared to age-/sex-matched reference cohorts, although differences were small and likely not clinically relevant. However, we identified subgroups of survivors reporting impaired QoL (27%), gLS (13%) and health-related life satisfaction (hrLS; 17%). Using multivariable regression models, we identified predisposing and protective factors for each of these outcomes. Treatment with alloHSCT did not adversely impact QoL, gLS, or hrLS. In summary, global QoL and LS in AML LTS are comparable to the general population, irrespective of treatment modality, although some survivors report clinically significant impairment of global QoL and/or in specific domains. We identified factors associated with impaired outcomes (e.g., comorbidity and fatigue), delineating a subgroup of survivors with unmet needs ≥5 y after their AML diagnosis.",
