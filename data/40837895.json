  "title": "A Rare Blue in the Pink: Benign Blue Nevus on the Gingiva in an Eight-Year-Old Child.",
  "abstract": "Oral melanocytic nevi are rare, benign tumors of unknown etiology that develop from melanocytes. The hard palate is where oral nevi most frequently occur, followed by the gingiva and buccal mucosa. Although asymptomatic, their clinical characteristics frequently necessitate a careful diagnosis of other pigmented diseases, including malignant melanoma. This report describes a rare instance of blue nevus in an eight-year-old female patient on the attached gingiva of the lower lip front region of the jaw. This case emphasizes how crucial it is to differentiate blue nevi from other melanocytic lesions using thorough clinical and histological analysis in order to guarantee an accurate diagnosis and suitable treatment, especially for children.",
