  "title": "<i>NUDT15</i> Pharmacogenetics in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: Synthesizing Progress for Personalized Thiopurine Therapy.",
  "abstract": "The management of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common pediatric malignancy, critically relies on thiopurine therapy, such as 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), during the maintenance phase. However, significant inter-individual response variety and high risk of myelosuppression often disrupt therapy efficacy. Pharmacogenetics offer crucial strategies to personalized therapy. While thiopurine methyltransferase (<i>TPMT</i>) was initially the primary focus, the discovery of <i>nudix hydrolase 15</i> (<i>NUDT15</i>) appears as a more comprehensive determinant of thiopurine intolerance. This review aims to consolidate and critically evaluate the advancement achieved in unraveling the biological mechanism and clinical significance of <i>NUDT15</i> pharmacogenetics in thiopurine therapy. Foundational studies showed the vital role of <i>NUDT15</i> in the detoxification of active thiopurines, with common genetic variants (for instance, p. Arg139Cys) significantly disrupting its activity, leading to the accumulation of toxic metabolites. Observational studies consistently associated <i>NUDT15</i> variants with severe myelosuppression, notably in Asian populations. Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) confirmed that <i>NUDT15</i> genotype-guided dosing effectively reduces thiopurine-induced toxicity without interfering with the therapeutic outcome. Despite these advancements, challenges remain present, including the incomplete characterization of rare variants, limited data in the diverse Asian populations, and the need for standardized integration with metabolite monitoring. In conclusion, <i>NUDT15</i> pharmacogenetics is essential for improving patient safety and thiopurine dosage optimization in the treatment of ALL. For thiopurine tailored medicine to be widely and fairly implemented, future research should focus on increasing genetic data across different populations, improving the dose adjustment algorithm, and harmonizing therapeutic guidelines.",
