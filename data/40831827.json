  "title": "Primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma Developing Within a B-cell Primary Hepatic Lymphoma in a Hepatitis C Positive Patient.",
  "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most prevalent form of primary liver cancer, commonly associated with chronic liver conditions like hepatitis and alcohol abuse. Primary hepatic lymphoma (PHL), a rare type of non-HodgkinÂ lymphoma originating in the liver, primarily affects men around the age of 50. Chronic hepatitis B and C are also recognized as risk factors for PHL. Although there are a few case reports of hepatocellular carcinoma and PHL developing simultaneously in different areas of the liver, this report highlights a unique case where hepatocellular carcinoma developed within a previously treated B-cell hepatic lymphoma, an extremely uncommon situation. This rare occurrence may be due to factors like chronic inflammation, liver disease, and the effects of treatment. MRI and CT scans are the main diagnostic methods, and follow-up imaging demonstrating a different imaging pattern within the tumor compared to the baseline imaging should prompt a tissue diagnosis with histopathological analysis to identify a new tumor subtype, or a new tumor altogether, as in our case. A multidisciplinary approach is essential for managing such cases, and close monitoring is vital as underlying liver disease and multiple cancers can greatly impact prognosis. Despite medical advancements, the prognosis for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma remains bleak, with a 5-year survival rate under 5% in advanced stages.",
