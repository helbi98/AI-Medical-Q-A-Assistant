  "title": "Degree of Adherence to Recommendations From the Spanish Consensus on the Reduction of Oral Corticosteroid Use in Asthma Patients: A Questionnaire-based Observational Study.",
  "abstract": "The Spanish consensus on the reduction of oral corticosteroid (OCS) use in asthma management was recently published to address the issue of OCS overuse in this area. This study evaluates the degree of awareness and implementation of this consensus by healthcare professionals.\nA longitudinal study was conducted with a survey completed by pulmonologists and allergists in 2 rounds conducted 6 months apart. Key metrics included OCS prescribing rates, adherence to recommendations, and other clinician-reported practices.\nBoth rounds were completed by 112 and 115 participants, respectively, with equal representation from allergists and pulmonologists. Most (91.1%) were familiar with the consensus, and 58.0% rated their knowledge as high. Fifty-three percent reported increased knowledge after 6 months. Regarding OCS dosing, 70.5% in the first round and 66.1% in the second round considered 5Â mg/day of prednisone to be low-dose therapy. A majority routinely calculated annual OCS doses, with a notable rise in the use of digital tools for dose calculations. Most clinicians favored 5-7 days for short OCS courses and supported the use of biologics for patients with uncontrolled severe asthma on maintenance OCS.\nThese findings suggest a notable reduction in OCS use and improved adherence to asthma management guidelines following the publication of the Spanish consensus. Repeated educational interventions appear effective in modifying prescribing behaviors and optimizing asthma care.",
