  "title": "A Cell-Surface-Targeted Fluorogenic Probe for Detection of Sulfatase 2 Activity.",
  "abstract": "Sulfatase 2 (Sulf-2), an extracellular sulfatase that modulates the sulfation pattern of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), serves as a critical biomarker for various pathological conditions. Monitoring Sulf-2 activity in living cell samples provides valuable insights for diagnostic applications and therapeutic evaluation of Sulf-2-related diseases. In this study, we developed a novel plasma-membrane-targeted fluorogenic probe, <b>MAR-S</b>, to visualize the activity of Sulf-2 secreted by living cells. Upon incubation with Sulf-2-containing culture supernatant from pancreatic cancer cells, <b>MAR-S</b> exhibited a significant increase in fluorescence at approximately 540 nm. Notably, <b>MAR-S</b> allowed for time-lapse monitoring of endogenous Sulf-2 activity in living cancer cells overexpressing Sulf-2, demonstrating its potential as a valuable tool for Sulf-2-related cancer diagnostics and therapeutic research.",
