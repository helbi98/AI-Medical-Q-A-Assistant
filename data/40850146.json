  "title": "Fabricating streptavidin-embedded metal-organic frameworks for noninvasive gene detection of Helicobacter pylori infection.",
  "abstract": "Gene detection of bacterial pathogens is vital for accurate and sensitive in vitro diagnostics (IVD), but the challenge remains in developing precise and sensitive nanoprobe technology for effective noninvasive testing. Herein, we innovate a new nanoprobe to achieve noninvasive precise and selective DNA capture and detection. Streptavidin-functionalized Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are developed by dynamic defect generation strategy, ensuring that biotinylated capture nanoprobes designed for gene(resistance genes and virulence genes) detection of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) are controllably anchored on the surface of the probes with high stability and sensitivity. Subsequent mutation analysis relies on melting curves following asymmetric PCR, significantly relieved the limitation of inaccurate mutation detection in traditional Taqman-PCR. Notably, our system exhibits exceptional sensitivity, specificity, and excellent stability. In summary, this platform enables personalized therapy for eradicating H. pylori, offering a new and promising direction in the field of in vitro diagnostics.",
