  "title": "Leukemia miRNA electrochemical biosensors.",
  "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 22-nucleotide-long non-coding RNAs that significantly regulate gene expression, making them crucial in various diseases, including cancer. Leukemias are hematological malignancies marked by the uncontrolled growth of white blood cells in the bone marrow. The dysregulated expression of miRNAs in these malignancies is linked to their progression and prognosis. Identifying key microRNAs can facilitate early diagnosis and expedite treatment and recovery by acting as crucial biomarkers in leukemia progression. Specific miRNAs, such as miR-155 and miR-181, have been linked to leukemia subtypes, influencing disease development and response to therapy. Recently, biosensors have emerged as a notable method for microRNA identification. These analytical devices possess high sensitivity and specificity for detecting biological agents. microRNA biosensors offer a non-invasive, rapid, and accurate approach to diagnosing leukemias. This review explores the design, functionality, and applications of miRNA electrochemical biosensors in detecting leukemia cancer.",
