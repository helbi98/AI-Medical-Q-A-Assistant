  "abstract": "Aim: This study examines the outcomes of patients undergoing PD to treat renal failure.\nMaterials and Methods: This is a prospective study conducted on patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis at Basrah Teaching Hospital. Information about patients and their PD experience was collected and analyzed. The researchers focused on identifying factors related to complications, particularly peritonitis. Peritonitis was diagnosed based on symptoms and the presence of white blood cells in the dialysis fluid.\nResults: The study included 71 participants, with a slightly higher number of male participants compared to female participants. The primary cause of kidney failure was diabetic nephropathy, affecting over one-third of patients. Diabetes combined with hypertension was the second most common cause. The most common complications experienced by patients were peritonitis, tube obstruction, and surgical site infection. Other, less frequent complications included death, catheter failure, catheter displacement, bleeding, leakage, and bowel injury.\nConclusions: Peritonitis is the most common complication of peritoneal dialysis. While other issues can arise, many are treatable and do not harm the dialysis catheter. Proper patient hygiene can significantly reduce the risk of complications and make peritoneal dialysis a successful treatment option.",
