  "title": "Radiologic and Pathologic Insights in Combined Hepatocellular-Cholangiocarcinoma: A Report of Three Cases.",
  "abstract": "<b>Background and Clinical Significance</b>: Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) is a rare primary liver malignancy exhibiting both hepatocellular and cholangiocellular features. Due to overlapping clinical, imaging, and pathological characteristics with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCC), diagnosis remains challenging. Early and accurate differentiation is critical for optimal treatment planning. <b>Case Presentation</b>: We report three histologically confirmed cases of cHCC-CC with different imaging features, biomarker profiles, treatment strategies, and clinical outcomes. Patient 1, a 69-year-old female, presented with a large centrally located liver mass exhibiting iCC-like imaging features and mildly elevated AFP and CA 19-9 levels. Biopsy confirmed poorly differentiated cHCC-CC. Treatment involved palliative chemotherapy, with a survival of 16 months following diagnosis. Patient 2, an 80-year-old female with a small lesion in a cirrhotic liver, demonstrated an HCC-like enhancement pattern but normal AFP levels. Surgical resection was performed, and histology confirmed cHCC-CC with a dual phenotype. Despite initial remission, intrahepatic recurrence developed, treated with TACE and systemic therapy. The patient later transitioned to palliative care due to progression and survived 36 months. Patient 3, a 67-year-old male with chronic hepatitis C, presented with an HCC-like lesion and elevated AFP. Due to comorbidities, surgical resection was not feasible, and the patient was treated with percutaneous microwave ablation as a safer alternative. Biopsy during ablation confirmed cHCC-CC; follow-up was ongoing at submission. <b>Conclusions</b>: These cases highlight the diagnostic complexity and clinical variability of cHCC-CC. Imaging may be misleading, and tumor markers do not reliably predict subtype or prognosis. Histological confirmation is essential, particularly in patients with atypical imaging or discordant biomarker profiles. Individualized management, informed by tumor biology and patient condition, remains critical. Further research is needed to refine diagnostic criteria and develop tailored therapeutic strategies for this challenging tumor entity.",
