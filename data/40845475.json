  "title": "Assessment of oxidative stress and trace element dynamics in acute myocardial infarction and heart failure: a focus on zinc, copper, and thiol dynamics.",
  "abstract": "Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) and Heart Failure (HF) are the leading global causes of death from Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD). This study aimed to investigate the association of serum Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu), and thiol levels with CVD and new potential biomarkers.\nThe study included serum samples from 150 participants, including 50 AMI patients, 50 HF patients, and 50 healthy individuals. Oxidative stress, trace elements (Cu and Zn), and thiol levels were investigated by automated kits in AMI and HF patients compared to the control group.\nT-thiol, N-thiol and Cu levels were higher in the AMI group than in the control group (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.01, respectively). Cu and Zn levels were higher in the HF group compared to the control group (p < 0.001, p < 0.01, respectively). Compared to the HF group, T-thiol (p < 0.05), N-thiol (p < 0.05), and Zn (p < 0.001) levels were higher in the AMI group. By ROC analysis, Zn, Cu and thiol levels showed moderate discriminative power, emphasizing their candidacy as biomarkers.\nDespite the limitations of age-related variations and sample size, this study pioneers the comparative analysis of AMI and HF, contributing to the elucidation of the complex connections between Zn, Cu and thiol levels in cardiovascular pathologies. It increases the importance of Zn, Cu and thiol levels in CVD's status, necessitating further research on this topic with refined methodologies.",
