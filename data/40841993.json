  "title": "The methylation of TXNRD2 with chronic heart failure: the interaction effect between methylation regulation and clinical parameters-- a single center pilot study.",
  "abstract": "This study investigated the potential role of <i>TXNRD2</i>_FA44 promoter methylation in chronic heart failure (CHF) and its influence on disease mechanisms. Additionally, we explored the association between specific Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) site methylation levels within the <i>TXNRD2</i>_FA44 promoter and various biochemical markers in CHF patients.\nThe study included 20 individuals suffering from chronic heart failure and an equal number of healthy participants. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF–MS), CpG sites in the <i>TXNRD2</i>_FA44 promoter region were pinpointed and measured. The comparison of methylation levels was conducted between CHF patients and healthy individuals. Statistics was used to analyze the relationship between <i>TXNRD2</i>_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 and various key biochemical indicators.\nPatients with CHF exhibited significantly higher methylation levels at <i>TXNRD2</i>_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 compared to controls (<i>P</i> = 0.0008). This elevated methylation level correlated with levels of creatinine (Crea), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), percentage of lymphocytes (LYMPH), albumin (ALB), globulin (GLB), and the albumin-to-globin ratio (A/G) in CHF patients.\nThe methylation level of <i>TXNRD2</i>-FA44 in patients with chronic heart failure is significantly higher than controls, and the methylation level of <i>TXNRD2</i>-FA44 is related to multiple liver and kidney function indicators. These findings suggest that TXNRD2-FA44 could serve as a biomarker for CHF diagnosis and may affect the occurrence and development of CHF through liver and kidney function.",
