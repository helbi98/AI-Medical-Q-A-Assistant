  "title": "Life satisfaction of carers of people with dementia of the Alzheimer type.",
  "abstract": "The aim of the study was to look for a correlation between personal resources, care burden and life satisfaction in carers of people with dementia of the Alzheimer type.\nThe study involved 100 family and professional carers providing care for a person with dementia of the Alzheimer type. Carers answered survey questions and completed questionnaires: Orientation to Life Questionnaire - SOC-29, Generalised Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), Social Support Questionnaire (F-SozU K-22), Depression Assessment Questionnaire (KPD), Perceived Stress Questionnaire (KPS), Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire (IEQ) and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS).\nHigher levels of a sense of satisfaction with life were observed in carers who had a higher education, were the sole carer of a person with the disease, and who spent less time providing care. Higher levels of available resources and a lower sense of care burden (fewer depressive symptoms, less involvement in care and less stress) were associated with a higher sense of life satisfaction. Depressiveness of carers and high levels of perceived stress reduce the level of satisfaction with life.\nPersonal resources play an important role among carers in reducing the burden and maintaining proper levels of life satisfaction. The proper management of the resources available to carers is important to counteract the negative consequences of caregiving.",
