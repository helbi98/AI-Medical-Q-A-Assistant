  "title": "HTSNPedia: A Molecular Perspective and Risk Estimator Database for Hypertension-Associated Genes.",
  "abstract": "Hypertension is a major public health concern, affecting more than one billion adults worldwide. The etiology of hypertension is associated with various genetic and epigenetic interactions. The candidate genes from various signaling pathways, such as RAAS, KKS and endothelin system, play a significant role in the progression of hypertension. The research aimed to develop a comprehensive knowledge base pertaining to hypertension, which would facilitate the integration of information related to SNPs associated with hypertension, pertinent biological pathways, risk assessment factors, molecular mechanisms, pharmacogenomic aspects of hypertension, a blood pressure calculator, and the existing literature on hypertension. This database has been implemented using HTML and Java programming languages. The deployment of the HTSNPedia database is expected to enhance the efficiency of identifying novel pharmacological drug candidates for the treatment of hypertension. A comprehensive understanding of the interrelationships among signaling pathways, molecular mechanisms, and risk-associated SNPs related to hypertension may significantly contribute to advancements in human health, particularly for individuals affected by this condition. The HTSNPedia is an openly accessible database, available at the following URL: https://www.generisk.in/HTSNPedia/main.html.",
