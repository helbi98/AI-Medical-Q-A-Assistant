  "title": "Investigating the interaction of ACKR1 and c-Myc in the breast carcinoma tumor microenvironment modulation.",
  "abstract": "This study investigates the interplay between the Atypical chemokine receptors (ACKR1)/Decoy receptor for chemokines (DARC) and key molecular markers, including CCL8, c-MYC, ALDH1, and CHEK2, in breast cancer. DARC has been implicated in various aspects of cancer progression, including tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. By analyzing the expression patterns of these markers in breast cancer tissues, we aim to understand their collective impact on tumor behaviour and identify potential therapeutic targets. Our findings reveal complex interactions between DARC and these molecular markers, suggesting their synergistic roles in promoting or repressing breast cancer progression. Understanding these relationships could lead to developing more effective and personalized therapeutic strategies.",
