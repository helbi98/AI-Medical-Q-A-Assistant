  "title": "Tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens: Biomarker discovery and clinical application.",
  "abstract": "Tumor-Associated Carbohydrate Antigens (TACAs) are carbohydrate structures uniquely expressed on the surface of tumor cells while being absent or minimally present in normal tissues. These molecular signatures play crucial roles in tumor progression, contributing to essential processes such as cell adhesion, motility, invasion, immune evasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, and proliferation. TACAs arise due to aberrant glycosylation, a hallmark of cancer cells, leading to their overexpression in various malignancies. Notably, elevated levels of certain TACAs have been associated with poor clinical outcomes in cancer patients. Because of their selective expression, TACAs serve as important biomarkers for cancer detection, prognosis, and disease monitoring. Their presence in the bloodstream of patients with epithelial carcinomas, neuroblastomas, and melanomas has led to the development of assays capable of quantifying these antigens in sera, providing valuable tools for clinical applications. The ability to measure TACAs in biological fluids enables early diagnosis and improved patient management, making them attractive targets for liquid biopsy strategies. Beyond their diagnostic utility, TACAs hold great promise for therapeutic applications, particularly in cancer immunotherapy. Their restricted expression on cancer cells makes them ideal targets for vaccine development, monoclonal antibody therapy, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell approaches. By exploiting the immune system's ability to recognize and target these antigens, novel treatment strategies are being explored to enhance anti-tumor immunity. Continued research into TACAs may lead to innovative diagnostic and therapeutic advancements, improving cancer patient outcomes and broadening the scope of precision medicine.",
