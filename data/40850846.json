  "title": "A preliminary economic evaluation of a potential program for the primary prevention of Alzheimer's disease.",
  "abstract": "We evaluated the potential cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical primary prevention screening and treatment program to avert the biological and clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in cognitively unimpaired older adults.\nThis hypothetical program would use an amyloid plaque-clearing antibody therapy monthly in the first six months and annually thereafter in cognitively unimpaired 55-79 year-old APOE4 carriers and 60-79 year-old non-carriers with a negative AD blood test (sensitivity and specificity of 0.9), averting the onset of moderately frequent neuritic amyloid plaques by 75 %. Lifetime hypothetical treatment outcomes were compared to natural history outcomes to estimate cost-effectiveness.\nThe program would be cost-effective up to a per-dose price of $1173 in APOE4 carriers and $307 in non-carriers or a lifetime cost of $20,167 and $5146, respectively.\nPrimary AD prevention could be cost-effective in older adults, especially in those at higher risk. Our findings and assumptions need to be confirmed with actual data.",
