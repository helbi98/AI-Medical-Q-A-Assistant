  "title": "Testosterone Enhances Wound Healing and Stress Resistance in A549 Lung Adenocarcinoma Cells via Actin Remodeling and AQP3 Upregulation.",
  "abstract": "The role of androgens in lung function is contentious, yet their effects on type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII)-derived lung cancer models remain underexplored. This study reveals that androgens provide survival advantages to A549 cells, a male lung adenocarcinoma AECII cell line, by promoting wound healing and enhancing stress resilience. We demonstrated that testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) significantly upregulate aquaporin 3 (AQP3) through androgen receptor (AR) accumulation and ERK pathway activation, thereby mitigating cell death under oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide and cyclic cell-stretching. Testosterone facilitated cellular wound healing by promoting actin cytoskeleton remodeling and focal adhesion complex formation, reliant on AR rather than AQP3. Under air-liquid interface culture conditions, testosterone consistently induced AQP3 upregulation, enhanced actin remodeling, and facilitated cellular wound healing responses. Validation of these findings was achieved through gene expression analyses, protein level assessments, cell imaging, and in vitro wound healing assays. The underlying molecular mechanisms of androgen action were elucidated using AQP3- and AR-specific siRNAs and pharmacological inhibitors. These findings underscore the urgent need to investigate the role of sex hormones in lung cancer and other androgen-responsive epithelial models, focusing on their influence on cancer cell survival and motility.",
