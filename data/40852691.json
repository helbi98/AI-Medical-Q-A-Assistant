  "title": "The Prognostic Value of C-Reactive Protein and Albumin in Newly Diagnosed Patients with AML.",
  "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Acute-phase reactant proteins, particularly C-reactive protein (CRP), play a critical role in the initiation, progression, and recurrence of cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> We retrospectively analyzed 127 newly diagnosed non-M3 acute myeloblastic leukemia (non-M3 AML) patients. We investigated pre-treatment levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), Albumin, and C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CAR) with cytogenetics, response to induction therapy, recurrence, and overall survival. <b>Results:</b> We did not find any relationship between levels of CRP, Albumin, and C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CAR) with complete remission rate, recurrence, and risk categorization of patients (P > 0.05). 3-and 5- year overall survival was 40.8% (with a standard error of 4.7%) and 30.1% (standard error: 5.3%), respectively. In addition, 3-year and 5-year event-free survival was 31.3% (standard error = 4.4%) and 25.8% (standard error = 4.8%), respectively. The only prognostic factor was allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT). <b>Conclusion:</b> Although CRP, Albumin, and CAR serve as convenient prognostic markers, they were not predictive of overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in AML patients. Further studies are needed in the future to confirm or refute our results.",
