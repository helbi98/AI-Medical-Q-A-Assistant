  "title": "Postpartum depression during the Syrian conflict, economic crisis, and COVID-19 outbreak in Syria.",
  "abstract": "The Syrian crisis, severe economic conditions, and the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly impacted the mental health of Syrians, including mothers who have given birth during these difficult times. These conditions have led to an increased prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD), exacerbated by inadequate responses to these crises.\nThe study aims to assess the prevalence of PPD among Syrian mothers during the Syrian crisis, economic crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic. It also seeks to identify the influence of these factors on the occurrence of PPD.\nA prospective longitudinal study was conducted between November 13, 2020 and April 27, 2021, in Damascus, Syria.\nPPD was evaluated among women who visited the Obstetrics and Gynecology University Hospital in Damascus, using the Arabic version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale after birth and again 6 weeks later. Pearson's chi-square test and logistic regression were used to investigate the correlation between the variables.\nA total of 402 women participated in the study, with only 378 remaining for follow-up at 6 weeks postpartum. The prevalence of PPD was found to be 46% immediately after birth and 25.3% 6 weeks later. Women's house devastation (Sig. 0.033, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.043-2.801), loss or injury of family members (Sig. 0.018, 95% CI: 1.110-3.008), and a preference for a female child (Sig. 0.034, 95% CI: 0.162-0.931) were significantly associated with PPD. We did not find an impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence of depression.\nDetecting and addressing PPD is crucial, especially during the Syrian crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, and ongoing economic difficulties, as these factors heighten stress during the postpartum period. Particular attention should be given to displaced mothers and those who have lost family members due to the conflict.",
