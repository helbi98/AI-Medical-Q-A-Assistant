  "title": "Pediatric azathioprine-induced pterygium formation in a patient with Crohn's disease: a possible sign of ultraviolet photosensitization.",
  "abstract": "We present the case of a 15-year-old boy on long-term azathioprine treatment for Crohn's disease who developed bilateral pterygia. He had no family history of pterygium formation, and he lived in a northern English town with a low ultraviolet (UV) index. This case highlights a possible association between azathioprine intake and development of pterygium, possibly attributable to UVA photosensitization. Pterygium primarily develops because of chronic ultraviolet-A (UVA) exposure. There is known to be a higher incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) development in patients taking azathioprine, due to this medication's UVA photosensitization effect on the skin. This raises the possibility that UVA photosensitization of ocular tissues in individuals taking azathioprine could perhaps increase the likelihood of pterygium, even in the pediatric age group, in which pterygium is generally considered to be rare.",
