  "abstract": "Real-world first-line maintenance (1LM) treatment data are limited for advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (a/mNSCLC).\nIn this electronic health record-derived, deidentified database study, eligible patients (≥18 years; diagnosed with stage III/IV non-small cell lung cancer [June 1, 2017-September 30, 2021]) initiated pembrolizumab-based 1LM after 4-6 cycles of first-line (1L) platinum-based chemotherapy-pembrolizumab ± pemetrexed. Study outcomes were real-world time to next treatment or death (rwTTNTD), overall survival (rwOS), and predictors of outcomes.\nOf 1944 patients analyzed (median follow-up, 12.2 months), 51.9% received 1LM pembrolizumab-pemetrexed and 48.1% pembrolizumab monotherapy. Median rwTTNTD and rwOS were 9.2 (95% CI: 8.5-9.8) and 18.7 (95% CI: 17.7-20.3) months, respectively. In multivariable analyses, factors significantly associated with shorter rwTTNTD included 5%-<10% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.34; 95% CI: 1.17-1.54) or ≥10% (HR, 1.69; 95% CI: 1.42-2.01) weight loss during 1L versus 0% or <5% weight loss. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression 1%-49% (HR, 0.81; 95% CI: 0.71-0.93) or ≥50% (HR, 0.55; 95% CI: 0.47-0.64) and female sex (HR, 0.85; 95% CI: 0.75-0.95) were significantly associated with longer rwTTNTD. These variables were also significantly associated with shorter (weight loss 5%-<10%: HR, 1.52; 95% CI: 1.30-1.77; ≥10% HR, 2.06; 95% CI: 1.71-2.48) and longer rwOS (PD-L1 expression: 1%-49% HR, 0.84; 95% CI: 0.72-0.98; ≥ 50% HR, 0.57; 95% CI: 0.48-0.68; female sex: HR, 0.81; 95% CI: 0.71-0.92).\nPredictors of real-world clinical outcomes included 1L treatment, weight loss, PD-L1 status, and sex. Poor outcomes persisted despite immunotherapy-based 1LM availability, revealing an unmet need in this population.",
