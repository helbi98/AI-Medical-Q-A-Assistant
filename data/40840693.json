  "title": "Safety and Efficacy of Budesonide/ Glycopyrrolate/Formoterol Fumarate (BGF) compared to Glycopyrrolate/ Formoterol Fumarate (GFF) for the Treatment of COPD: A Systematic Review & Meta Analysis.",
  "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive illness characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and restricted airflow, often due to smoking and prolonged exposure to environmental irritants. COPD significantly impacts the pulmonary vasculature, lung parenchyma, and airways, leading to structural abnormalities such as emphysema. This study compares the safety and effectiveness of Budesonide/Glycopyrrolate/Formoterol (BGF) MDI with Glycopyrrolate/Formoterol (GFF) MDI in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, focusing on adverse events and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1).\nA comprehensive literature search was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. The search encompassed databases such as PubMed, Medline, clinicaltrials.gov, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, web of science, and google scholar up to April 2024. Search terms included \"COPD,\" \"dual therapies,\" \"triple therapies,\" \"LABA,\" \"LAMA,\" \"BGF MDI,\" \"FEV<sub>1</sub>,\" and \"COPD exacerbation.\" Only English-language randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving patients aged 40-80 years who were current or former smokers with confirmed COPD were included. Additionally, reference lists of included studies were screened. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool.\nThrough initial literature review, we obtained 4022 articles out of which finally 4 articles were included in the current study. Results showed a significant rise in FEV1 with BGF MDI compared to GFF MDI at 4, 24, and 52 weeks. At 52 weeks, the pooled mean difference in FEV1 was 46.48 mL [95% CI: 25.26; 67.71]. Safety profiles were similar, with adverse events such as nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections observed in both treatments.\nBGF MDI significantly improves lung function compared to GFF MDI in moderate-to-severe COPD and has a comparable safety profile. Further large-scale studies are needed to confirm long-term safety.",
