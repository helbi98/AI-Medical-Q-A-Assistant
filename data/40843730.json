  "title": "Are Calculated Immune Markers with or Without Comorbidities Good Predictors of Colorectal Cancer Survival? The Results of a Longitudinal Study.",
  "abstract": "Although numerous prognostic biomarkers have been proposed for colorectal cancer (CRC), their longitudinal evaluation remains limited. The aim of this study was to investigate longitudinal changes in biomarkers calculated from routinely used laboratory markers and their relationships to common chronic diseases (comorbidities).\nA retrospective longitudinal observational study was completed with the inclusion of 817 CRC patients and a total of 4542 measurement points. Pan-immune inflammation value (PIV), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) were calculated based on complete blood count and albumin measurement data.\nLongitudinal data analyses confirmed the different values and slopes of the parameters tested at the different endpoints. Survivors had the lowest and most constant PIVs and SII values, and the highest and most slowly decreasing PNI values. Those patients with non-cancerous death had similar values to the previous cohort, but an increase/decrease occurred towards the death event. Patients with CRC-related death had significantly higher PIVs and SII values and significantly lower PNI values (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), and a significant increase/decrease was observed at the early observational periods. The presence of lymph node and/or distant metastases, adjuvant chemotherapy, and hypertension significantly affected PIVs and SII and/or PNI values. The changes in PIVs and SII and PNI values toward pathological values are poor prognostic signs (<i>p</i> < 0.0001).\nEach of the three calculated markers demonstrates suitability for longitudinal patient follow-up, and their pathological alterations over time serve as valuable prognostic indicators. They may also be useful to detect certain clinicopathological parameters early.",
