  "title": "Reappraisal of Alternative Treatments for Non-melanoma Skin Cancers on YouTube: A Cross-Sectional Analysis.",
  "abstract": " Social media plays a significant role in patient education as many US Internet users obtain health information online. YouTube is a popular search engine among people looking for dermatologic advice. Our study assesses the content on homeopathic remedies for non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) available on YouTube.\n We searched YouTube in a private browsing tab for \"natural skin cancer remedies,\" \"alternative skin cancer treatment,\" and \"holistic skin cancer treatment\" in separate searches. The top 40 videos meeting inclusion criteria in each search were analyzed. For data extraction, the video characteristics, engagement metrics and content themes were recorded. Duplicates were removed.\n 61 videos were analyzed in total. 22 (36.1%) of the videos were created by homeopathic YouTube channels, 20 (32.8%) by laypeople and/or influencers, 11 (18%) by physicians and pharmacists, 4 (6.7%) by news channels, and 4 (6.7%) by other personnel. The 10 most frequently mentioned remedies included green tea (n=12, 19.7%), turmeric/curcumin (n=12, 19.7%), coconut oil (n=9, 14.8%), black salve (n=7, 11.5%), apple cider vinegar (n=7, 11.5%), baking soda (n=7, 11.5%), garlic (n=7, 11.5%), frankincense oil (n=6, 9.8%), eggplant (n=6, 9.8%), and milk thistle (n=6, 9.8%).\n Although most videos were created by homeopathic channels, they had the lowest engagement. Videos created by healthcare professionals achieved significantly higher engagement. Thus, even when seeking natural remedies on social media, viewers prefer content created by professionals. There is some existing literature on the role the recommended remedies play in preventing and/or treating skin cancers.\n Dermatologists should be aware of the various at-home therapies patients may try for their skin cancer. They should consider creating their own reliable and accurate social media content to educate the public about the risks of these dangerous trends and emphasize the importance of seeking evaluation for suspicious skin lesions.",
