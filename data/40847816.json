  "title": "Healing Through Empowerment and Active Listening: Experience-Based Co-Design of a Nurse-Led Personalised Self-Care Support Intervention for Primary Care Patients With Diabetic Foot Ulcers.",
  "abstract": "The rising prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) highlights the need for effective self-care interventions. Despite strong evidence supporting their effectiveness, patient engagement, uptake, and integration into routine care remain limited. Co-design approaches can enhance the relevance and adoption of interventions but are underutilized in DFU management.\nThis study outlines the development of Healing through Empowerment and Active Listening (HEALing), a self-care intervention for patients with DFU, grounded in Self-Determination Theory and Motivational Interviewing, and developed using an experience-based co-design approach.\nThe 27-month co-design process consisted of three phases involving patients, caregivers, healthcare professionals(HCPs), and researchers from across primary care in Singapore. Phase 1 (16 months) included qualitative interviews with patients (N = 27), caregivers (N = 5), and HCPs (N = 8), analyzed via reflexive thematic analysis, alongside a quantitative survey (N = 186), analyzed using structural equation modelling to identify intervention determinants. Phase 2 (9 months) involved co-design workshops with patients (N = 10) and wound care nurses (N = 6) to define the intervention's content and delivery approach. In Phase 3 (2 months), iterative meetings refined the intervention's procedures, tools, and materials. Qualitative data from Phases 2 and 3 were thematically analyzed.\nKey barriers to DFU self-care included limited control over ulceration and treatment, low confidence, negative emotions, and misperceptions about the condition. Personalised care and clinician-facilitated motivation emerged as key enablers. HEALing targets five core self-care components: (1) wound care, (2) foot care and footwear, (3) diabetes care, (4) treatment seeking, and (5) managing worries and concerns. The personalised components are delivered using a card-sorting tool during clinic-integrated sessions by trained wound care nurses. The HEALing delivery pathway comprises three 30-min sessions at 2-week intervals. During workshops, participants perceived HEALing as supporting patient- and clinician-endorsed person-centred care and collaborative planning, while also identifying potential implementation challenges, including training needs and structural barriers.\nHEALing positions patients as experts by experience, addressing the psychological and behavioural complexities of DFU care. This nurse-led and stakeholder-endorsed intervention is currently undergoing feasibility evaluation.\nIndividuals with DFUs, their caregivers, and those with post-healing in remission, and wound care nurses as service users contributed to co-design HEALing by identifying intervention targets and shaping the intervention's content and delivery.",
