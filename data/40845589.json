  "title": "Genistein ameliorates thoracic aortic dissection by inhibiting CB1 receptor hyperactivation and modulating its-mediated cAMP-PKA signaling.",
  "abstract": "Thoracic aortic dissection (TAD) is a fatal cardiovascular disease characterized by vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotypic remodeling and inflammation. Cannabinoid 1 (CB1/Cnr1) receptor has been implicated in cardiovascular diseases, but its role in TAD and its downstream signaling remains unclear. Genistein (Gen), an isoflavone abundant in legumes, has demonstrated promising therapeutic potential in cardiovascular diseases such as vascular calcification, hypertension, and atherosclerosis due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and metabolic regulatory properties. However, the role of Gen in the progression of TAD remains poorly understood.\nThe present study was designed to investigate the potential of Gen in alleviating medial degeneration and delaying TAD progression by inhibiting the CB1 receptor and modulating its associated cAMP-PKA signaling.\nIn vitro and in vivo experiments evaluated the effects of AM251, a selective CB1 receptor antagonist, and genistein (Gen), a natural CB1 receptor inhibitor, on VSMC remodeling, NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis, and TAD progression. The involvement of cAMP-PKA signaling was validated using the PKA inhibitor H-89.\nCB1 receptor was highly expressed in VSMCs and significantly upregulated in TAD group, while cAMP-PKA signaling was suppressed. Elevated CB1 receptor expression correlated with increased NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis and enhanced VSMC phenotypic modulation. AM251 and Gen treatment restored cAMP-PKA signaling, reduced pyroptosis, and preserved the contractile phenotype of VSMCs, thereby delaying TAD progression. However, overexpression of CB1 receptor diminished the beneficial effects of Gen treatment in VSMCs. Single-cell RNA sequencing further confirmed that Gen reversed the CB1 receptor -induced suppression of cAMP-PKA signaling and mitigated VSMC remodeling. Notably, the protective effects of Gen were abrogated upon PKA inhibition by H-89, highlighting the essential role of cAMP-PKA activation. In vivo, Gen administration significantly reduced TAD incidence, improved aortic wall integrity, and decreased inflammatory cell infiltration.\nCB1 receptor overexpression contributes to TAD development by suppressing cAMP-PKA signaling, promoting pyroptosis, and inducing VSMC remodeling. Genistein exerts protective effects via CB1 receptor inhibition and cAMP-PKA upregulation, suggesting CB1 receptor as a promising therapeutic target for TAD.",
