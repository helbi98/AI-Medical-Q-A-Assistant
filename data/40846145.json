  "title": "Latent tuberculosis infection and sexually transmitted diseases in incoming mobility students at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.",
  "abstract": "Little is known about latent tuberculosis infection and sexually transmitted diseases in international mobility students, due to the limited number of educational institutions that provide care for these types of health problems. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection and the presence of some sexually transmitted diseases in the population of incoming mobility students of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), as well as their socio-demographic, migratory and health characteristics; in order to contribute to the design of strategies for the detection of asymptomatic diseases that may have an impact on the health of this population.\nIncoming mobility students of the UNAM were invited to participate in the study, underwent a clinical history and physical examination, and informed consent was requested for the collection of blood to determine the presence of TB and some sexually transmitted diseases. Socio-demographic, migration and health characteristics were recorded.\n149 incoming mobility students were recruited, with a prevalence of 7.3% of latent TB. None of the students were positive for HIV and HCV, and only one student was positive for syphilis.\nThe prevalence of latent TB was 7.3%. LTB and sexually transmitted diseases in high-risk populations, such as international mobility students, was unknown in our country. It is important to continue with research projects aimed at reducing the burden of disease in this population and to promote the development of strategies that inform educational institutions about their presence, control and prevention.",
