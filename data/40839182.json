  "title": "Effects of Nigella sativa and its constituents on inflammatory markers in ovalbumin-induced asthma model: a preclinical systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "Research demonstrates that Nigella sativa (N. sativa) and its principal constituents, including thymoquinone, thymol, carvacrol, and α-hederin, possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the preclinical evidence of N. sativa in an animal model of ovalbumin-induced asthma.\nAn investigation into the role of N. sativa and its constituents in an animal model of ovalbumin-induced asthma was conducted, covering the period from the beginning until July 2025, utilizing the Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated using the 15-point CAMARADES checklist. Data analysis was performed using STATA software.\nA total of eighteen studies encompassing 502 animals, with 251 assigned to the intervention group and 251 to the ovalbumin-induced group, were subjected to analysis. The findings from the meta-analysis indicated that N. sativa and its constituents significantly reduced the levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-17. Furthermore, there was a notable decrease in immunoglobulin E (IgE) following the intervention with N. sativa and its active components. However, the levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) remained unchanged as a result of the intervention with N. sativa and its active ingredients.\nBased on current meta-analysis results, N. sativa and its constituents may have the potential to modulate the asthma model induced by ovalbumin through their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Therefore, it is advisable to conduct further clinical trials to assess the efficacy of N. sativa in patients diagnosed with asthma.",
