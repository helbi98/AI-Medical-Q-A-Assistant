  "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a prevalent comorbidity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We aimed to investigate the impact of sarcopenia diagnosed by chest CT on mortality in critically ill patients with exacerbation of COPD (ECOPD).\nThis retrospective study enrolled 148 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit due to ECOPD from 2018 to 2023. Sarcopenia was defined by the skeletal muscle index measured at the 12th thoracic vertebra (T12) level on chest CT. Patients were categorized into the sarcopenia and non-sarcopenia groups. Hospitalization duration, short-term (30 and 90-day) and long-term (1-year and overall) COPD-related mortality and all-cause mortality were compared between the two groups. Cox regression analyses were conducted to recognize the risk factors for mortality, and a sarcopenia-based nomogram was developed.\nEighty-four patients (56.76 %) with sarcopenia were identified through chest CT measurements. The 1-year COPD-related and all-cause mortality, as well as overall COPD-related and all-cause mortality, were significantly higher in the sarcopenia group than the non-sarcopenia group (19.05 % vs. 4.69 %, p = 0.010; 28.57 % vs. 6.25 %, p = 0.001; 33.33 % vs. 15.63 %, p = 0.015; 47.62 % vs. 29.69 %, p = 0.027, respectively). Multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed sarcopenia as a risk factor for 1-year (HR = 3.981 [1.137-13.938], p = 0.031) and overall (HR = 2.308 [1.310-4.065], p = 0.004) mortality. The sarcopenia-based nomogram demonstrated favorable prognostic performance.\nSarcopenia evaluated at the T12 level on chest CT may serve as a prognostic factor for predicting long-term mortality among critically ill patients with ECOPD.",
