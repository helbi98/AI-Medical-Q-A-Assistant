  "title": "Penetrating cardiac injuries of the left ventricle - a case series and review of literature.",
  "abstract": "Penetrating cardiac injuries (PCIs) remain a significant surgical challenge, characterized by high mortality rates, particularly in young adult males. The mechanism of injury (gunshot wound vs. stab wound) significantly influences outcomes.\nThis study presents two cases of left ventricle PCIs, emphasizing the need for prompt diagnosis and intervention. The rising incidence of PCI necessitates a high index of suspicion based on clinical findings and basic imaging to facilitate timely surgical intervention and potentially improve survival.\nTwo patients presented within 48Â hours at a South African hospital. Case 1 involved a 32-year-old male with a stab wound to the anterior left ventricle, injuring the left anterior descending artery. Case 2 involved a 26-year-old male with a gunshot wound (GSW) to the posterior left ventricle. Both underwent immediate surgical repair.\nThe clinical presentations, diagnostic approaches (including eFAST), and operative techniques are described. Postoperative courses varied significantly; one patient developed complications including severe hypertension and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, while the other had an uncomplicated recovery. A literature review highlights inconsistencies in reported PCI incidence and mortality, largely attributed to small sample sizes and methodological limitations in previous studies.\nThe increased frequency of GSWs and stab wounds causing PCIs underscores the importance of a high index of suspicion supported by clinical findings and basic imaging to enable rapid surgical intervention. This expeditious approach could potentially improve mortality rates. Further research with larger, well-designed studies is crucial to refine our understanding of PCI management and improve outcomes.",
