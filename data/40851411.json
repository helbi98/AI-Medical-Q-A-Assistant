  "abstract": "Various Vicia species belonging to the Fabaceae family are known to be used in different parts of the world both in human nutrition and as animal feed, and also have pharmacological potential in the prevention and treatment of various diseases. With this perspective, in the present study, the possible antiparkinsonian effects of extracts prepared from Vicia canescens subsp. variegata were investigated in cell culture and on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced Parkinson's model rats. The effects of the plant on the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease were evaluated by biochemical and histopathological analyses; in addition, the structures of the compounds isolated from the active extracts were elucidated and the in vitro antioxidant and antiparkinsonian activities of these compounds were determined.\nMethanol and n-butanol extracts prepared from the aerial parts of V. canescens subsp. variegata showed significant antiparkinsonian effects both in cell culture and in a rat model. Histopathological and biochemical analyses were also parallel to in vivo experiments. As a result of the isolation studies, six flavonol glycosides were obtained from the plant, and their antioxidant capacities as well as antiparkinsonian effects were subsequently evaluated. The highest biological effect was observed in quercetin-3-O-α-l-rhamnopyranoside (quercitrin, VCB-3).\nIn the light of the studies, the antiparkinsonian effects of V. canescens subsp. variegata was evaluated. It was seen that they prevented neurodegeneration and the oxidative stress that occurred, and the most effective compounds were determined. Two new compounds named viciacoside A and B have been added to the literature as a result of this research. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.",
