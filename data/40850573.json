  "abstract": "Cystic echinococcosis, a zoonotic parasitic disease, is caused by the larvae of Echinococcus granulosus. It is a global public health problem with significant disease burden in India.\nTo determine the prevalence and epidemiological characteristics of cystic echinococcosis (CE) in the study population, thereby providing insights into its burden, seasonal trends, and geographical distribution to inform effective control and prevention strategies.\nThis prospective study evaluated the seroprevalence of human cystic echinococcosis (CE) in 545 serum samples collected at a tertiary care hospital from August 2022 to July 2024. Clinical and laboratory data from patients with suspected CE were analyzed to identify associations with demographic and geographical factors. Statistical tests, including the Chi-square test, were conducted to explore the trends, correlations, and risk factors in patients with CE.\nOf the 545 serum samples tested, 252 (46.23%) were positive for Cystic Echinococcosis IgG antibodies. The age group of >18-49 years had a significantly higher number of seropositive patients(p= 0.019). A statistically significant association was found between gender and cystic echinococcosis, with males showing a significantly higher seropositivity rate compared to females (M:F-1.2:1). Rural residence and a history of contact with dogs was strongly associated with a higher rate of CE seropositivity. Among these 252 seropositive patients, majority of cases were seen in liver (56.7%, 143) followed by lung (23.4%), both liver and lung (10.7%), spleen (3.96%), and kidney (1.58%).The districts with the highest seropositivity for Echinococcus granulosus cases were Lucknow and Raebareli followed by Sitapur and Barabanki.\nThe high prevalence of Cystic Echinococcosis according to this study highlights the need for surveillance and integrated control measures to prevent this disease in humans and livestock across the country. Addressing this issue in India requires a One Health approach integrating human, animal, and environmental health strategies.",
