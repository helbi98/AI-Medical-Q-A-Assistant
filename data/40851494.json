  "title": "POT1 genetic testing in melanoma-prone families in Sweden: germline variant prevalence and tumor spectrum in identified carriers.",
  "abstract": "Approximately 5-10% of cutaneous melanoma occurs in individuals with a family history of the disease. While known high-penetrance genes, such as CDKN2A, explain some cases, a substantial proportion of hereditary melanoma remains genetically undefined. Recently, germline variants in genes involved in telomere regulation, including POT1, TERT, ACD, and TERF2IP, have been identified in melanoma-prone families. This study investigated the prevalence and pathogenicity of POT1 variants in a Swedish familial melanoma cohort. Patient/material and methods: A total of 168 familial melanoma cases were screened for CDKN2A, CDK4, BAP1, and POT1. The population frequency of pathogenic variants (PVs) was assessed using the SweGen and the gnomAD databases. Functional evaluation was performed using a saturation genome editing (SGE) assay. Telomere length analysis was performed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on blood-derived DNA from melanoma patients and healthy controls. The melanomas of the carriers were reviewed by expert dermatopathologists.\nAmong the 161 CDKN2A/CDK4/BAP1-negative melanoma families included in this cohort, only one likely PV in POT1 (c.676C > A, p.His226Asn) was identified (0.6%). Population data confirmed its rarity. The carrier family exhibited multiple early-onset melanomas, with two out of three invasive cases displaying spitzoid morphology, and several other tumors. No significant telomere length differences were observed between carriers and controls. Two additional POT1 variants of uncertain significance were detected; both were predicted to be benign.\nPOT1 PVs were rare in the studied Swedish familial melanoma cases, implying limited contribution to hereditary melanoma in this population. Nonetheless, the identification of a previously unknown likely PV further supports the need for continued genetic screening in selected cases. POT1 testing should be considered in families with multiple melanomas, early onset and spitzoid histopathology, and co-occurring with other syndromic tumors.",
