  "abstract": "HIV infection remains a major public health challenge globally. Healthcare workers (HCWs) face an increased risk of occupational exposure to HIV through their routine duties. Adequate knowledge on HIV postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is imperative for preventing HIV infection following exposure to blood and body fluids. However, few studies have examined the level of knowledge on HIV PEP and the associated factors among this at-risk population of HCWs in Tanzania. The aim of this study was to assess the level of knowledge on HIV PEP and associated factors among HCWs in Kigoma Region, Tanzania. A cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs at Kigoma Regional Hospital, Kibondo District Hospital and Kasulu Town Council Hospital from November to December 2022. Data was collected using interviewer-administered questionnaire. A total of nine questions were used to assess knowledge on HIV PEP. The total score was calculated by summing the correct responses, with a maximum possible score of 17. Knowledge of HIV PEP was classified as inadequate (score < 11, moderate (score 12-14), and adequate (score > 14). Bivariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the association between the level of knowledge on HIV PEP (inadequate/moderate (score ≤ 14) vs. adequate (score > 14) and the independent variables. Data analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Scientists version 23.0 and p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Out of 377 study participants [female (200, 53.1%), mean age of 38.7 ± 9.1 years, nurse 129 (34.2)] the majority 234 (62.1%) had adequate knowledge on HIV PEP. HCWs from Kasulu Town Council Hospital (AOR = 1.4; 95% CI: 1.02-8.73) and those from facilities with HIV PEP services (AOR = 3.9; 95% CI: 2.41-6.29) had significant higher odds of having adequate knowledge on HIV PEP. A sizeable proportion of study participants had adequate knowledge on HIV PEP. Working in Kasulu Town Council Hospital and presence HIV PEP services within the facility were associated with adequate knowledge on HIV PEP. Healthcare authorities in the Kigoma region are advised to strengthen the implementation of formal HIV PEP training, timely access to HIV PEP service, and dissemination of updated information education communication materials alongside protocol guidelines to improve the knowledge of HCWs on HIV PEP in all healthcare facilities.",
