  "title": "Mapping the evolution of kainate receptor research over five decades: trends, hotspots, and emerging frontiers.",
  "abstract": "Kainate receptors (KARs), a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors, play critical roles in the brain by participating in fundamental functions such as synaptic plasticity. The abnormal expression, distribution, and function of KARs have been implicated in a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including epilepsy. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of kainate receptor (KAR) research over the past five decades (1975-2024), mapping its evolution, identifying key trends and hotspots, and highlighting emerging frontiers. The goal was to offer a systematic overview of the field's development, global contributions, and translational potential to guide future research and clinical applications. We conducted a scientometric analysis using CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Bibliometrix to evaluate 11,671 publications retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Data were deduplicated and analyzed for annual publication trends, country and institutional contributions, journal impact, author productivity, and keyword evolution. Thematic clustering and citation burst analysis were used to identify research hotspots and shifts over time. Representative studies from different periods were reviewed to contextualize bibliometric findings. The field of KAR research output peaked in the early 2000s, driven by breakthroughs in molecular cloning and regional distribution studies, followed by a decline and recent stabilization. The USA led in productivity and impact, while China showed rapid growth post-2015. Keyword analysis revealed three phases: molecular characterization (1995-2005), functional and disease-related studies (2005-2015), and advanced technologies (2015-2024) including cryo-electron microscopy and single-cell RNA sequencing. Key challenges include limited clinical translation of KAR modulators and their unresolved roles in psychiatric disorders. The Journal of Neuroscience was the most prolific journal, and authors such as Mulle C and Mayer ML were among the top contributors. This study provides the first bibliometric roadmap of KAR research, highlighting its dynamic evolution, global collaboration patterns and unmet translational needs. Future directions should prioritize subunit-specific drug design, cross-disciplinary innovation, and equitable global collaboration to bridge the gaps between molecular insights and clinical applications. These findings serve as valuable resources for researchers, policymakers, and clinicians in neuroscience and pharmacology.",
