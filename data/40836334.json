  "title": "Epidemiology and surveillance of influenza, RSV and SARS-CoV-2 in children admitted with severe acute respiratory infection in West bengal, India from 2022 to 2023.",
  "abstract": "Evaluating the burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza among young children in LMICs is crucial to inform implementation policies, given the importance of maternal influenza and RSV vaccination, which may not yet be widely available.\nThis study established a one-year surveillance of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) from June 2022-2023 in hospitalized children 1-24 months from rural West Bengal India. We tested nasopharyngeal swabs collected from children admitted with SARI using multiplex real-time PCR for influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2, with a subset (N = 81) tested for additional respiratory pathogens and analyzed clinical features, factors influencing infections, and hospitalization duration.\nOf 1842 children admitted with SARI, 77% (1419) were between 1 and 24 months. Of 191 sampled, 21 required intensive care, and 3 died. The majority of mothers (83.7%) were vaccinated against COVID-19, but none against influenza, pertussis, or RSV. Viruses were detected in 44% (84/191), with RSV being the most common 60/190 (31.6%), followed by influenza 12/190 (6.3%), and SARS-CoV-2 2/191 (1%). Influenza subtypes included influenza A/H3 (6/16), A/H1N1pdm (5/16), Influenza B (4/16), and Influenza C (1/16). RSV peaked during autumn, influenza during winter and monsoon. Influenza was more common in infants < 6 months (13.4%, p = 0.03). RSV affected both infants under 6 months and over similarly (34% vs. 29.6%, p = 0.5). Infants < 6 months frequently required oxygen support (p = 0.02), though ICU admissions were similar (p = 0.98). RSV was associated with 19% of ICU admissions and influenza with 14%. Additional pathogens included Haemophilus influenzae (23.45%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (22%), rhinovirus (13.6%), parainfluenza virus group (6.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (8.6%), Moraxella catarrhalis (5%), bocavirus (3.7%), adenovirus (3.7%), Chlamydia pneumoniae (1%), and Bordetella (1%). Viral-bacterial co-detection occurred in 34%, especially in infants < 6 months. Children with RSV had increased risk of having S. pneumoniae [Odds Ratio OR 6.2, 95% CI 1.8-21.3]. Rhinovirus cases were associated with ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and longer length of stay, regardless of age.\nRSV and influenza were the key contributors to SARI in children under-2. Findings highlight the need for diagnostics to guide vaccination, reduce antibiotic use, and improve indoor air quality for alleviating the SARI burden in rural settings.",
