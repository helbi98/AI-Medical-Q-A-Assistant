  "title": "Cardiac disease in patients with vasculitis.",
  "abstract": "Cardiac involvement has been described in many forms of vasculitides and is associated with worse outcomes. However, data on the incidence of structural and arrhythmic heart disease is limited.\nFor this single-center study, we recruited 191 patients with giant-cell arteritis (GCA, n = 109), Takayasu arteritis (TAK, n = 26), polyarteritis nodosa (PAN, n = 3), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, n = 38), or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, n = 15) between August 2023 and January 2025. The primary study endpoint was the incidence of structural or arrhythmic heart disease after the diagnosis of vasculitis.\nThe demographic characteristics of patients diagnosed with vasculitis differed significantly between those with GCA, TAK, PAN, GPA, and EGPA. Arterial hypertension and dyslipidemia at baseline were more prevalent among patients with GCA, while chest pain and signs of congestion were more frequently reported by patients with EGPA. No significant difference between the five main subgroups were found regarding the incidence of documented arrhythmic diseases. Cardiac imaging was performed using echocardiography in 70% of the overall cohort and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in 11%. CMR detected left ventricular systolic dysfunction and myocardial fibrosis in 33% and 40% of EGPA patients, respectively. All four cases of acute myocardial infarction occurred in patients with GCA. Among 19 GCA patients who underwent coronary angiography, 21.1% underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. In the EGPA group, coronary angiography was performed in 46.7% of patients, but none required percutaneous intervention. A substantial proportion of patients was treated with acetylsalicylic acid (50.3%), beta-blockers (41.9%), or ACE-inhibitors/AT1-receptor antagonists (60.2%).\nSevere cardiac complications occurred rarely, although cardiovascular risk factors, structural abnormalities, and arrhythmias affected a substantial proportion of patients with vasculitis, highlighting the potential benefit of systematic screening and multidisciplinary management.",
