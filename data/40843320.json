  "title": "Evaluation of indoor air pollution in children with asthma.",
  "abstract": "The unfavorable effects of air pollution on respiratory health have been shown in many studies. Exposure to air pollution can lead to developing asthma and losing control over existing asthma. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the investigation of indoor air pollution in children with asthma.\n130300 measurement data obtained from all participants' home environments (29 patients diagnosed with asthma and 13 controls) were compared. The BLATN BR-SMART Multi-function Air Quality Monitor measured PM<sub>2.5</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and formaldehyde (HCHO) levels.\nThe age and sex distributions of the patients and controls were similar. The median age of asthmatic patients was 14 years (IQR: 9), and the median age of controls was 13 years (IQR: 9). The number of household members in the homes of asthmatic patients (median: 4, IQR: 1) was significantly higher than the controls (median: 3, IQR: 1) (p=0.035). Asthmatic patients' houses were closer to the highway than the controls (p=0.019). The frequency of homes being closer than 100 meters to the main road was higher in asthmatics (n=17, 65.4%) than in controls (n=3, 23.1%) (p=0.019). Based on all measurements, indoor CO<sub>2</sub> and HCHO levels in the asthmatic patient group were higher than in the controls. Although the PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels were also higher in asthmatic patients, this difference was statistically insignificant. According to indoor air pollution parameters throughout the day, PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels were found to be higher in asthmatic patients, especially between 18.00 and 06.00, when the number of people in the house was the highest.\nIndoor PM<sub>2.5</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and formaldehyde levels in patients with asthma were higher than controls. Management of environmental factors along with medical treatment is also essential to achieve better asthma control.",
