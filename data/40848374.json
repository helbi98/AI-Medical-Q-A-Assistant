  "abstract": "This study investigate opportunistic pathogens Cryptosporidium spp, Giardia intestinalis, Blastocystis, and microsporidia species in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection using molecular methods, and to identify associated risk factors.\nThe study included 100 randomly selected HIV-seropositive patients, along with 50 healthy individuals as the control group. Participants who reported receiving antiparasitic treatment during the study period were excluded. Conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect Blastocystis and microsporidia, while nested PCR was employed to identify Cryptosporidium spp. and G. intestinalis.\nBlastocystis was found in 22% of the of HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, as was microsporidia in 17%, Cryptosporidium spp. in 12%, and G. intestinalis in 11%. In the control group, Blastocystis was detected in 8%, microsporidia in 6% and Cryptosporidium spp. in 2%, while G. intestinalis was not detected. The differences in the prevalence of G. intestinalis (p = 0.001), Cryptosporidium spp. (p = 0.009), microsporidia (p = 0.013), and Blastocystis (p = 0.029) between the patient and control groups were statistically significant. Multiple parasitic infections were identified in 12% of HIV/AIDS patients, whereas no cases of multiple parasitism were observed in the control group.\nHIV/AIDS patients were found to be at increased risk for G. intestinalis, Cryptosporidium spp., microsporidia, and Blastocystis. Given the presence of multiple parasitism, stool samples from HIV/AIDS patients should be routinely screened using comprehensive diagnostic methods targeting all major intestinal parasites.",
