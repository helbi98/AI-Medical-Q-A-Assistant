  "title": "A 19F Blake Drain versus a 28F Conventional Drain Following Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Esophagectomy for Esophageal Cancer: A Comparative Retrospective Study.",
  "abstract": "Pleural drainage is essential for preventing and managing respiratory complications after video-assisted thoracoscopic esophagectomy (VATE). Conventional large-bore drains often cause significant pain. Small-bore drains (e.g., 19F Blake drains) may reduce discomfort; however, evidence regarding their use in VATE is limited. This study compared drainage effectiveness and pain between 19F Blake drains and conventional 28F drains after VATE for esophageal cancer.\nThis retrospective study included 77 male patients with middle- or lower-third esophageal cancer who underwent VATE with laparoscopic retrosternal tunneling from November 2018 to November 2022. Fifty-five patients received a 28F conventional drain, and 22 received a 19F Blake drain. Outcomes included drainage duration and volume, pain levels (Visual Analog Scale [VAS]), postoperative pneumonia rates, and pulmonary function (forced vital capacity [FVC], forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]) on postoperative day 3.\nThe 19F group reported significantly lower pain scores on postoperative days 1-3 (VAS: 2.95-3.25 vs. 4.07-4.62, p<0.001). Drainage duration and pneumonia rates were similar between groups. The 19F group demonstrated a trend toward higher drainage volume and significantly better preservation of pulmonary function, with smaller declines in FVC (ΔFVC: 0.24±0.20 L vs. 0.63±0.17 L, p<0.001) and FEV1 (ΔFEV1: 0.38±0.25 L vs. 0.58±0.25 L, p=0.02).\n19F Blake drains provide similar drainage effectiveness to that of 28F drains, with reduced postoperative pain and better pulmonary function preservation. These findings support the use of 19F Blake drains to improve patient comfort and recovery following VATE.",
