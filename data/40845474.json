  "title": "Long-term pioglitazone use in MASLD patients: insights from a multicentric preliminary study.",
  "abstract": "This multi-center retrospective study evaluated the long-term effects of pioglitazone therapy on liver stiffness, hepatic steatosis, and other non-invasive biomarkers in patients with Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD).\nA total of 65 patients from three Brazilian public hospitals treated with pioglitazone at doses of 30‒45 mg/day up to 10-years were retrospectively analyzed. Hepatic parameters, including Vibration-Controlled Transient Elastography (VCTE), Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP), and FibroScan-AST score, were evaluated before and after treatment. Patients were stratified into two groups based on treatment duration: 1‒3 years and 4‒10 years.\nSignificant reductions in Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) levels were observed in both treatment groups, indicating improvement in liver enzyme profiles. A significant decrease in CAP levels was observed only in the 4‒10 year group (p = 0.002), suggesting a reduction in liver steatosis. Improvement in FAST™ scores was observed in both groups (1‒3 years, p = 0.042; 4‒10 years, p = 0.012). In logistic regression analysis, dyslipidemia was associated with a non-significant trend toward higher odds of liver stiffness reduction (adjusted OR = 1.92, 95 % CI 0.58‒6.45, p = 0.284).\nThese findings highlight both the metabolic and hepatic benefits of long-term pioglitazone therapy. They reinforce its potential as a cost-effective and accessible treatment option for MASLD, particularly in resource-limited settings where newer therapeutic alternatives are unavailable.",
