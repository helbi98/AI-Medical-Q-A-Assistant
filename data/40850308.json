  "title": "A methyl-to-acetyl switch in H3K27 drives metabolic reprogramming and resistance to BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibition in melanoma.",
  "abstract": "The BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> pathway and epigenetic machinery are central to melanoma pathogenesis. However, how these processes intersect and their potential for synthetic lethality remains unclear. Here, we identified a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-driven epigenetic mechanism in melanoma that involves a H3K27 methylation-to-acetylation switch, facilitating metabolic adaptation to targeted therapies. Inhibition of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> downregulates the methyltransferase EZH2, leading to KDM6A-mediated removal of H3K27me3 and a subsequent increase in H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac). This H3K27 methyl-to-acetyl conversion shifts chromatin from a repressive to an active state, thereby promoting gene transcription through the acetylation reader BRD4. Specifically, the KDM6A-H3K27ac-BRD4 axis upregulates PGC1Î±, a master regulator of mitochondrial metabolism, enabling melanoma cells to sustain oxidative metabolism and survive BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-targeted therapies. Blocking this H3K27 methyl-to-acetyl switch disrupted metabolic adaptation and sensitized melanoma cells to BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibition. In conclusion, we revealed an epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming mechanism that enables melanoma to survive the treatment with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitors, presenting druggable targets within the H3K27 modification pathway that could enhance the efficacy of BRAF-targeted therapies in melanoma patients.",
