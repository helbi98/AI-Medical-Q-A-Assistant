  "abstract": "Although school-supervised inhaled corticosteroid administration has potential to improve asthma morbidity, there has yet to be an evaluation of the pediatric practice as a setting to identify children with asthma and connect them to school-supervised asthma therapy.\nConduct a pragmatic pilot trial of Asthma Link, a model that connects children with asthma seen in pediatric practice to supervised asthma therapy in the school setting.\nFour pediatric practices were pair-matched and randomized to (1) Asthma Link plus an asthma educational workbook or (2) Enhanced Usual Care, the same workbook alone. We recruited children 6 to 17 years old with poorly controlled asthma, prescribed a daily inhaled corticosteroid. Parent-child dyads completed surveys at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months.\nrecruitment/retention of pediatric practices and parent-child dyads and intervention fidelity.\nasthma symptoms, medication adherence, emergency room visits, hospital admissions, oral steroid use, missed schooldays.\nFour pediatric practices and 66 parent-child dyads were recruited (average child age 9 y, 44% female, 65% Hispanic, 23% Black, 62% low income). All (4 of 4) practices were retained throughout the study and retention of parent-child dyads was 95%, 91%, and 89% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. All (31 of 31) Asthma Link families brought their child's preventive inhaler into school; children received school health staff-supervised therapy on more than 95% of schooldays over 12 months. Children in the Asthma Link group had greater improvement in Asthma Control Test scores, longer time to first asthma exacerbation, less oral steroid use, and better medication adherence compared with the Enhanced Usual Care group.\nExtending the reach of pediatric practices to facilitate the delivery of daily asthma prevention medication at school was feasible and improved pediatric asthma morbidity.",
