  "title": "Exploring the multifaceted roles of glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 1 as a biomarker and therapeutic target in colorectal cancer and pan-cancer analyses.",
  "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a global health issue requiring novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to improve patient outcomes. Glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 1 (GOT1) plays a crucial role in metabolism and is associated with various cancers. However, its expression and potential as a diagnostic marker in CRC have not been thoroughly investigated. We analysed The Cancer Genome Atlas data on GOT1 normalised to transcripts per million. We used tools such as Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2, logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic analysis, Sieber algorithm for immune detection, immune checkpoint gene correlation, cBioPortal analysis, and genomic sensitivities of cancers from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer and Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal to evaluate the association of GOT1 with CRC. GOT1 expression significantly varied across cancer types, showing high diagnostic value in colon adenocarcinoma and rectal adenocarcinoma. Moreover, it correlated with immune cells, such as CD8<sup>+</sup> T and plasma cells, and immune checkpoint genes LGALS9 and TNFRSF4. Tumour genetic variations differed in mutation burden, copy number alterations, and microsatellite instability. Drug sensitivities, including those of navitoclax and CCT036477, showed an association with GOT1 expression. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses suggested the involvement of GOT in cellular metabolism. Our comprehensive analysis revealed a critical role of GOT1 in CRC, confirming its role as a diagnostic and therapeutic target. Nonetheless, its role in tumorigenesis warrants further investigation.",
