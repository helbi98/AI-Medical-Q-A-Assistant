  "title": "Altered mitochondrial DNA methylation in blood in individuals with mild cognitive impairment.",
  "abstract": "Previous studies reported that altered mitochondrial methylation in Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, whether epigenetic modifications in mitochondrial genomes contribute to preclinical AD remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate mitochondrial methylation changes in individuals with cognitive decline.\nWe examined whole mitochondrial genome methylation in 50 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 50 individuals without MCI, using bisulfite amplicon sequencing, assessing methylation at 366 Cytosine-guanine oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG) sites.\nWe found the overall methylation level of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in each subject was relatively low, ranging from 0% to 15%. Global methylation was significantly higher in individuals with cognitive decline compared to controls (3.86% vs. 3.46%, <i>p</i> = 0.037), with 34 differentially methylated CpG sites identified. Methylation differences (MD) between cognitive decline individuals and controls were 22.93 ± 5.60% at chrM6465 (Q = 0.013), 12.55 ± 3.02% at chrM9612 (Q = 0.013), 11.45 ± 3.88% at chrM11762 (Q = 0.159) and 11.03 ± 3.88% at chrM11766 (Q = 0.172), respectively, while the level of MD at chrM15812 was -13.11 ± 4.31% (Q = 0.159) after Benjamini-Hochberg FDR adjusted. Furthermore, Methylation at specific sites were significantly correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination scores, distinguishing individuals with cognitive decline from controls.\nOur study provides an mtDNA methylation map and suggests a role for these sites in preclinical AD pathogenesis.",
