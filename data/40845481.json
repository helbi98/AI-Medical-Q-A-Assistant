  "title": "Precision Medicine: Therapeutically Targeting Mitochondrial Alterations in Heart Failure.",
  "abstract": "A substantial component of the increasing global burden of cardiovascular disease is attributed to heart failure (HF), affecting over 64 million adults worldwide. Maladaptive mitochondrial respiratory alterations and oxidative stress are major contributors to HF development and progression, with subsequent downstream myocardial energetic impairment as a strong predictor of mortality. Current conventional therapeutic approaches, including renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition and Î²-adrenergic blockade, target neurohormonal aspects of HF and are effective in slowing disease progression. However, although these therapies may be associated with some improvement in myocardial energetics, they do not specifically address alterations in myocardial mitochondrial respiration or redox homeostasis. Targeting mitochondria has hence become a promising approach for more effective and tailored therapies. This review summarizes metabolic derangements that drive HF progression, with a specific focus on mitochondria. Importantly, here we address the essential knowledge gaps in the field, highlighting key translational strategies used to date, and the challenges associated with therapeutically targeting mitochondrial pathways, alongside recent developments seeking to deploy novel mitochondrial-targeted therapeutic approaches to treat HF.",
