  "title": "Prevalence and clinical characteristics of fibromyalgia syndrome in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A cross-sectional study.",
  "abstract": "ObjectiveThis study investigated the prevalence of fibromyalgia syndrome in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and examined its association with the demographic and clinical variables of these individuals.MethodsA cross-sectional design was used to compare 100 individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with 100 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Fibromyalgia syndrome was diagnosed based on the 2016 American College of Rheumatology criteria.ResultsThe prevalence of fibromyalgia syndrome was significantly greater in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (16%) than in healthy controls (3%) (p = 0.048). In the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease group, female patients exhibited a markedly higher prevalence of fibromyalgia syndrome than male patients (31.6% vs. 6.4%, p = 0.035). No significant associations were found between the presence of fibromyalgia syndrome and patient age, disease duration, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease severity. Patients with both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and fibromyalgia syndrome frequently reported increased fatigue, sleep disturbances, and depressive symptoms.ConclusionsThese findings underscore the clinical relevance of fibromyalgia syndrome as a comorbidity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, particularly in women, and highlight the need for its routine screening in respiratory care. Incorporating fibromyalgia syndrome assessment may improve symptom management and support a more holistic approach to rehabilitation and disease management in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.",
