  "abstract": "Background Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious global health concern, particularly for healthcare workers and medical students who are at elevated occupational risk due to their clinical exposure. Despite the availability of effective vaccines, knowledge gaps and suboptimal prevention practices persist. Objective To assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of medical students at the University of Medical Sciences and Technology in Sudan regarding HBV infection. Methods A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted among 235 medical students in their third to fifth years. Data were collected using a validated, self-administered questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS, version 26; IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Armonk, NY). Descriptive statistics were calculated, and associations were tested using chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, and Spearman's rank correlation. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Of the 235 participants, 54.9% demonstrated good knowledge of HBV, 68.1% had a fair attitude, while 56.2% showed poor preventive practices. Significant associations were found between knowledge and age (p=0.007), occupation (p<0.001), and source of information (p=0.014). Gender significantly influenced practice levels (p=0.033). Positive correlations were observed between knowledge and attitude (p<0.001), knowledge and practice (p=0.001), and attitude and practice (p<0.001). Conclusion Although most students were knowledgeable and held fair attitudes toward HBV, a large proportion failed to adopt appropriate preventive practices. Mandatory vaccination, clinical training reinforcement, and awareness campaigns are recommended to improve student preparedness and reduce occupational HBV risks.",
