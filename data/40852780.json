  "title": "A comparative analysis of the clinical effect of multiple treatments for benign breast tumors.",
  "abstract": "PurposeThis retrospective study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes, safety profiles, and postoperative recovery characteristics of conventional open surgery, ultrasound-guided minimally invasive rotary cutting, and microwave ablation in the treatment of benign breast tumors, using historical patient data.MethodsIn total, 164 patients with benign breast tumors treated at Haidian Hospital, Beijing, from January 2020 to January 2023 were selected as study participants. Based on the treatment received by the patients, they were divided into three groups: open surgery group (87 patients treated with conventional open excision surgery), rotary cutting group (65 patients treated with Micromotion minimally invasive rotary cutting under color Doppler ultrasound guidance), and ablation group (12 patients treated with microwave ablation). Subsequently, key indicators, including operation time, intraoperative blood loss, incision length, incision healing time, postoperative pain score, incidence of postoperative complications, and aesthetic outcome of the breast, were comprehensively compared and analyzed among the three groups.ResultsStatistical analysis revealed significant differences (P < 0.05) among the groups in terms of operation time, intraoperative blood loss, incision length, incision healing time, and postoperative pain scores at 24, 48, and 72 h. Specifically, the ablation group showed significantly lower values for these parameters compared with the rotary cutting and open surgery groups. The rotary cutting group exhibited better outcomes than the open surgery group across these metrics. In addition, the incidence of postoperative complications and aesthetic outcome of the breast in the ablation and rotary cutting groups were significantly better than those in the open surgery group (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed in the incidence of postoperative complications and the aesthetic outcome of the breast between the ablation and rotary cutting groups (P > 0.05).ConclusionCompared with conventional open surgery, microwave ablation and Micromotion minimally invasive rotary cutting under color Doppler ultrasound guidance demonstrate superior surgical outcomes, lower postoperative pain levels, and reduced incidence of postoperative complications in the treatment of benign breast tumors. Microwave ablation offers shorter operation time, less intraoperative blood loss, faster postoperative recovery, and significantly greater pain relief while providing better aesthetic outcome of the breast.",
