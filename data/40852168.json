  "abstract": "Nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) has been increasingly used therapeutically for breast cancer patients in whom the nipple-areolar complex is not involved, being associated with better esthetic results and QOL than skin-sparing mastectomy. Robotic nipple-sparing mastectomies (R-NSM) using da Vinci SP surgical system (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) has been reported as a suitable surgical treatment for early breast cancers. We present a patient who underwent R-NSM and IBR, with excellent results. To our knowledge, this is the 1st reported case of R-NSM and IBR using the da Vinci SP surgical system in Japan.\nWe performed R-NSM for a 41-year-old Japanese woman with cTisN0M0 breast cancer. NSM and IBR to place a tissue expander (TE) into the post-pectoral pocket were performed using the da Vinci SP surgical system with the double bipolar method.\nThis is the 1st reported case of R-NSM using da Vinci SP surgical system in Japan.",
