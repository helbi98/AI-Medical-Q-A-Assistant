  "title": "Intraocular Pressure Outcomes Following Suprachoroidal Triamcinolone Acetonide in Patients With Glaucoma, Ocular Hypertension, or Steroid Response.",
  "abstract": "<b>Purpose:</b> To examine the effect of suprachoroidal triamcinolone acetonide on intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with a known history of glaucoma, ocular hypertension, or steroid response. <b>Methods:</b> This was a multicenter, retrospective cohort study examining patients with glaucoma, ocular hypertension, or a prior steroid response who received suprachoroidal triamcinolone acetonide between February 1, 2022, and December 31, 2023. Patient charts were reviewed to record IOP at the time of treatment with suprachoroidal triamcinolone acetonide and at follow-up. <b>Results:</b> Ten (17%) of 59 eyes experienced an IOP increase of 5 mm Hg or greater following suprachoroidal triamcinolone acetonide injection. At follow-up, 3 eyes (5%) were documented to have an IOP of greater than 25 mm Hg, and no eyes were found to have an IOP greater than 35 mm Hg. Notably, 30 (79%) of 38 eyes with a prior steroid response did not develop an IOP elevation of 5 mm Hg or higher. When removing eyes that had prior incisional glaucoma surgery, 17 (68%) of 25 eyes with prior steroid response still did not develop an IOP elevation of 5 mm Hg or greater. No eyes in this study required glaucoma surgery following suprachoroidal triamcinolone acetonide within the follow-up period. The mean follow-up from initial suprachoroidal triamcinolone acetonide to first visit was 42.0 days. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study examined patients who would be considered high-risk for intraocular steroid therapy. In this population, there was a lower tendency to have an IOP response following suprachoroidal triamcinolone acetonide compared with published rates of IOP elevation from intraocular steroids in eyes without a known steroid response. All patients receiving local corticosteroids should be monitored for IOP elevations.",
