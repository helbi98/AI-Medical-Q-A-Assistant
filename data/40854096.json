  "title": "Web-Based Assessment of Cognition and Dementia Risk Factors in Over 3000 Norwegian Adults Aged 50 Years and Older: Cross-Sectional PROTECT Norge Study.",
  "abstract": "With the growing number of older adults in the Norwegian population and the associated rapid rise in dementia and cognitive impairment, novel and more efficient methodologies are needed to facilitate research, improve diagnostic triage, and deliver effective brain health interventions in the community. Platform for Research Online to Investigate Genetics and Cognition in Ageing Norge (PROTECT Norge) is a web-based, remote research platform on the aging brain, culturally adapted from the UK PROTECT study, incorporating a Norwegian cohort of adults aged 50 years and older, where participants complete study activities via a dedicated website. Data were collected through study activities, which included self-reported questionnaires and a computerized neuropsychological test battery.\nThe study aimed to assess associations between dementia risk factors, including obesity, hypertension, smoking, and hearing loss, and cognition using baseline data from the PROTECT Norge study.\nData from the PROTECT Norge study were used to assess associations between dementia risk factors and cognition. These associations were assessed using independent-sample t tests for each of the cognitive tests, which included paired associate learning, self-ordered search, digit span, and verbal reasoning tasks.\nDuring the first 2 years of data collection, records from 3214 participants were obtained. Associations between established risk factors and cognitive performance were found, with significant detriments to cognitive performance on the computerized neuropsychological test battery. In the PROTECT Norge cohort, consisting of 74.5% females, the mean age was 64.1 (SD 7.7), and 94% of participants provided consent for contact regarding future research.\nThese data show the associations between dementia risk factors and cognition and attest to the excellent feasibility of the PROTECT Norge cohort, with over 3000 participants included over a period of 2 years and accessibility for people with early cognitive impairment. This, combined with the cohort's willingness to participate in future studies (94%), positions PROTECT Norge as a tremendous opportunity for cost-efficient, large-scale brain health research and potentially for clinical digital cognitive health programs.",
