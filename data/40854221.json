  "title": "Glucagon Receptor Deficiency Causes Early-Onset Hepatic Steatosis.",
  "abstract": "In this study, we investigated a consanguineous family in whom normal-weight individuals had hepatic steatosis and cirrhosis. Using whole-exome sequencing we found two rare homozygous variants in the glucagon receptor (GCGR) gene that cosegregated with the phenotype. In cells, the GCGR mutations result in a loss of function and increased lipid accumulation. These results highlight the potential risks associated with GCGR antagonists and the benefits of GCGR agonists, currently in clinical trials.",
