  "abstract": "Posttraumatic growth (PTG) refers to positive psychological changes following adversity, including deeper relationships and a greater appreciation for life.\nTo assess PTG among intensive care unit (ICU) health care professionals 4 years after the COVID-19 pandemic and explore its association with resilience, anxiety, and depression.\nThis cross-sectional study invited ICU health care professionals (nursing staff, medical staff [residents, interns, clinical fellows, and senior intensivists], and other professionals providing patient care) in ICUs in general or university-affiliated hospitals in France and Belgium to complete online questionnaires between March 15 and May 15, 2024.\nPTG, resilience, anxiety, and depression.\nThe primary outcome was PTG, and secondary outcomes were anxiety, depression, and resilience. Participants completed validated self-reported questionnaires, including the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 10). Visual analog scales (VASs) assessed professional experiences and psychological impact. Multivariate linear regression identified factors associated with PTG.\nAmong 1371 health care professionals in 23 ICUs, 850 (62%) responded (median age, 39 years [IQR, 32-46 years]; 574 [68%] women). The median PTGI score was 50 (IQR, 33-64), with nursing staff reporting higher PTG than medical staff (51 [IQR, 34-65] vs 47 [IQR, 28-61]; P = .02), mainly in personal strength, spiritual change, and appreciation of life. Anxiety and depression symptoms were present in 492 respondents (58%) and 219 respondents (26%), respectively. Lower PTG was associated with psychological fatigue (regression coefficient, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.91-1.96; P < .001), ICU conflicts (regression coefficient, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.05-1.19; P = .03), and perceived deterioration in family-centered care (regression coefficient, -7.47; 95% CI, -1.10 to -13.80; P = .02). Higher PTG was correlated with higher resilience (Spearman correlation coefficient, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.17-0.30; P < .001) and was associated with a change in personal life since the pandemic (regression coefficient, 1.80 [95% CI, 1.13-2.47] per VAS point; P < .001).\nIn this cross-sectional study performed 4 years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, ICU health care professionals, particularly nursing staff, exhibited significant PTG. Resilience, rather than psychological distress, emerged as a key driver of PTG, and deterioration in family-centered care was a major contributing factor, underscoring the need for targeted well-being and resilience-building strategies to enhance health care professionals' mental health and professional fulfillment while also improving patient and family care.",
