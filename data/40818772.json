  "title": "Mortality Outcomes and ACE Inhibitor Use in Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.",
  "abstract": "ACE inhibitors (ACEi) are widely used antihypertensive agents with proven cardioprotective effects. Previous mechanistic and clinical studies have suggested ACEi therapy may slow disease progression and reduce mortality in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).\nDoes ACEi use associate with reduced all-cause in a real-world population of IPF patients, and if so, is the association also present in COPD patients?\nA retrospective analysis was conducted using electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD database (2019), linked with HES Admitted Patient Care and ONS death registration data. Patients with IPF and COPD were stratified based on ACEi use (defined as â‰¥3 prescriptions within the five years preceding diagnosis) and matched by age, gender, and smoking history using propensity score matching. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed, adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, smoking status, indices of multiple deprivation, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and common cardiovascular comorbidities. In the IPF cohort, competing risk analysis was used to account for cause-specific mortality.\nThe study included 3,579 patients with IPF and matched COPD controls (mean age 74 years, 36% female). Among the IPF cohort, 1,326 (37%) were ACEi users, compared to 1,061 (30%) amongst COPD patients. ACEi use was associated with improved survival, independent of co-existing comorbidities, in IPF patients (HR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.81-0.98, p = 0.013), but a similar association was not found in COPD patients (HR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.95-1.25, p = 0.234).\nACEi therapy was independently associated with reduced all-cause mortality in IPF, but not in COPD. Prospective trials are warranted to confirm these findings in IPF populations.",
