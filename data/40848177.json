  "title": "Systematic review of exosomes derived from various stem cell sources: function and therapeutic potential in disease modulation.",
  "abstract": "Exosomes, nanosized extracellular vesicles ranging from 30 to 150Â nm, are secreted by all cell types through the endocytic pathway and have emerged as promising candidates for both biomarkers and therapeutic agents due to their capability to transport bioactive molecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids between cells. This intercellular communication facilitates numerous biological processes, including cellular signaling, immune modulation, and tissue regeneration. Despite their therapeutic potential, a comprehensive understanding of the diverse functions and clinical applications of exosomes remains limited, representing a significant gap in the current biomedical literature. To address this, we conducted a systematic analysis of 27 relevant studies examining exosome applications across various medical fields including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular conditions, cancer therapy, regenerative medicine, autoimmune disorders, inflammatory diseases, and respiratory ailments. Our findings demonstrate that exosomes actively participate in immune regulation, angiogenesis, and tissue repair mechanisms. However, several challenges must be overcome to translate these findings into clinical practice, such as establishing standardized large-scale production methods, achieving precise cargo loading and targeted delivery, and ensuring safety regarding immunogenicity and biodistribution. In conclusion, our study highlights the critical role of exosomes as leading cell-free therapeutic tools and underscores the necessity for further research to validate their potential as substitutes for cell-based therapies, thereby advancing innovative, non-cellular treatment strategies in clinical medicine.",
