  "title": "3D collagen high-throughput screen identifies drugs that induce epithelial polarity and enhance chemotherapy response in colorectal cancer.",
  "abstract": "Loss of polarity is a hallmark of cancer, and the related epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype impacts prognosis and therapy outcomes, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the mechanisms and drugs that impact EMT-related morphological changes are understudied, due to the complete failure of typical live/dead 2D high-throughput screens to capture morphology or the lack of robustness of 3D screens. We designed a high-throughput screen using 3D type I collagen cultures of CRC cells to assess morphological changes in colonies and identified several FDA-approved drugs that re-epithelialize CRC colonies. One of these drugs, azithromycin, increased colony circularity, enhanced E-cadherin membrane localization and ZO-1 localization to tight junctions, caused transcriptomic changes consistent with downregulation of EMT, and elevated sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic, irinotecan. A retrospective analysis of patient data demonstrated that the use of azithromycin in patients undergoing treatment for CRC with irinotecan had improved the 5â€‰year survival compared to the chemotherapy alone. These results highlight the importance of morphological screens to identify novel drug candidates and synergistic mechanisms.",
