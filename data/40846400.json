  "title": "Intravenous immunoglobulin for chronic active antibody-mediated rejection: a signal of hope in an evolving field.",
  "abstract": "Chronic active antibody-mediated rejection remains a leading cause of transplant failure, with no approved therapies and limited clinical guidance. The randomized, open-label VIPAR trial evaluated prolonged high-dose IVIG treatment, providing preliminary evidence of histologic and functional benefits. Despite a small sample size and inherent methodological limitations, the study offers meaningful insights to the limited evidence base and supports further systematic investigation of IVIG as a potential therapeutic option for antibody-mediated rejection.",
