  "title": "Prevalence and factors associated with Hepatitis B infection in the general population: a cross-sectional study in Moshi municipality, North-Eastern Tanzania.",
  "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a significant public health problem, even with the presence of affordable and effective vaccination. Toward hepatitis B elimination by 2030, it is essential to know the prevalence of HBV in the general population and associated risk factors so as to set priorities for specific prevention and control strategies in this population.\nThis was an analytical cross-sectional study among 1399 general population aged 18 years and above who came for HBV screening during the world viral hepatitis day on 28th and 29th July 2019. Serological marker of HBV was done using Determine HBsAg 2 Rapid Test. Data were cleaned and analyzed using STATA version 15.1. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for factors associated with HBV infection.\nThe mean age of all study participants was 43.3Â±16.1 years, 57.4% were aged 40 years and above, and 57.8% were females. The positive rate of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was 2.4%. Significantly higher odds of HBV infection were among respondents aged 30-39 (OR=2.70, 95%CI 1.22, 5.97, p=0.01) compared to those aged 40 years and above and those with a history of HBV infection (OR=8.46, 95%CI 2.66, 26.86, p<0.001).\nThe prevalence of hepatitis B infection is at an intermediate epidemic level in a semi-urban population in North-eastern Tanzania. Particular attention should be among middle-aged adults, such as those aged 30-39 years compared to their older counterparts and those with a history of HBV infection.",
