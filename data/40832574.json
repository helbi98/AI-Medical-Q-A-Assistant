  "title": "World Hepatitis Day 2025: Progress and Challenges in the Global Elimination of Viral Hepatitis.",
  "abstract": "The year 2025 marks the 15th anniversary of World Hepatitis Day, a milestone that has witnessed remarkable progress in global viral hepatitis prevention and treatment. This article systematically examines the establishment and evolution of World Hepatitis Day, emphasizing the latest achievements in hepatitis control through 2025. Current data demonstrate that global hepatitis B vaccine coverage has surpassed the 90% target, while a cumulative 12,748,000 hepatitis C patients received direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) treatment from 2014 to 2023. Despite these advances, persistent challenges, including suboptimal diagnosis rates and pronounced regional disparities continue to impede progress toward the 2030 elimination objectives. Drawing from the most recent epidemiological data, this article presents targeted recommendations to accelerate global elimination efforts.",
