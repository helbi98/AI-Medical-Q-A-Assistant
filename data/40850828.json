  "abstract": "Low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) is a common bowel dysfunction syndrome following sphincter-preserving surgery for rectal cancer, characterized by stool storage dysfunction and evacuatory dysfunction. It has become a critical factor adversely affecting patients' quality of life and long-term clinical outcomes. Currently, the pathogenic mechanisms of LARS remain incompletely elucidated, and high-quality evidence to guide clinical practice is still lacking. However, emerging evidence suggests that strategic optimization across the clinical management pathway-including precision oncology planning, surgical technique selection, multidimensional symptom profiling, proactive prevention protocols, and comprehensive symptom management-may effectively reduce LARS severity and improve survivorship outcomes. Given the absence of consensus guidelines for LARS management among clinicians across China, the Chinese Society of Coloproctology (Chinese Medical Doctor Association) organized domestic experts in relevant fields. Through systematic review of global research findings, integration of international expertise and guidelines, and adaptation to domestic clinical realities, we developed the \"Chinese Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (2025 Edition)\". This consensus elaborates on key aspects including the definition, clinical manifestations, risk factors, pathophysiological mechanisms, symptom assessment, treatment modalities, and prevention strategies for LARS, aiming to standardize the diagnosis and management of LARS in China.",
