  "abstract": "Maternal hypertensive disorders (MHDs) remain a critical global health challenge, disproportionately impacting low-resource regions. Using GBD (Global Burden of Disease, Injury, and Risk Factor Study) 2021 data, we first analyze global MHD epidemiology from 1990 to 2021 and project trends to 2035.\nAge-standardized rates and estimated annual percentage change quantified incidence, prevalence, mortality rate, and disability-adjusted life years. Trends were stratified by sociodemographic index (SDI) and geography. Decomposition analysis attributed temporal variances (1990-2021) to demographic aging, population dynamics, and epidemiological shifts. Temporal patterns were assessed via age-period-cohort and Bayesian models, while socioeconomic disparities were measured using Slope and Concentration Index of Inequality, and frontier analysis identified SDI-specific optimal burden thresholds.\nNew MHD cases rose 15.2% (1990: 15.7 million; 2021: 18.1 million), while deaths and disability-adjusted life years declined by ≈29% (0.038 million deaths; 2.47 million disability-adjusted life years in 2021). Age-standardized incidence fell from 554 to 462 per 100 000 (estimated annual percentage change: -0.51). Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia bore the highest burden. Higher SDI quintiles demonstrated lower MHD burdens, though all metrics exhibited more pronounced declines in lower-SDI regions during 1990-2021. Women aged 25 to 29 years faced elevated risks, with incidence peaking in this group. Bayesian age-period-cohort modeling projects consistent global declines in incidence, disability-adjusted life years, prevalence, and mortality rates through 2035.\nDespite progress, inequities in MHD burden persist across SDI levels. Targeted interventions in high-risk regions, particularly enhancing prenatal care access and mitigating age-specific risks, are critical. Strengthening primary health care systems and prioritizing maternal health quality could reduce preventable complications.",
