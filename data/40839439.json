  "abstract": "Caregivers play an important role in their child's asthma management. This study examines the association of caregiver empowerment with family asthma management, and the patient-provider relationship for urban children and their caregivers.\nData were collected between 2011 and 2014. Participants were racially diverse dyads of caregivers and children (<i>N</i> = 141) between 7 and 9 years old diagnosed with asthma, living in urban school districts.\nResults showed that caregiver empowerment was not associated with family asthma management; however, better family asthma management ratings were related to having a caregiver born in the United States who spoke English, and an annual family income above the poverty threshold. Caregiver empowerment was inversely associated with the patient-provider relationship, suggesting that caregiver increased comfort in navigating one's community and health services was associated with lower ratings of the patient-provider relationship.\nThe findings highlight the importance of considering caregiver empowerment when understanding the patient-provider relationship for children diagnosed with asthma.
